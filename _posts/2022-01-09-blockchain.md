custom_excerpt: "Some of my thoughts on blockchains and the technologies built atop them."
---

Until recently, my feelings towards blockchains and cryptocurrency have been ones of apathy and mild annoyance. I have been apathetic towards and mildly annoyed by many things—Bluetooth headphones, most “smart home” devices—and have found my general well-being is best served by just ignoring them and moving on with my life. Pick my battles, right? But I do try to balance my curmudgeonliness with a willingness to revisit my opinions, and some periodic reevaluations of my stances have resulted in change—in fact, I now have a pair of Bluetooth headphones that I use daily and quite like (despite my continued annoyance that I can’t use them while they’re charging, and their propensity to try to connect to any device besides the one I am using).

It was such a reevaluation that led me to shift my stance on blockchains and cryptocurrency. I had been hearing more and more about blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and some “web3” thing in conversations with friends, various technology spaces, the news... well, kind of everywhere. I knew my information and therefore my opinions were outdated and incomplete, so I did some research. As with Bluetooth headphones, my opinion changed. But instead of going from apathy to acceptance, I have instead come to believe that these technologies are so harmful that I cannot ethically continue to ignore them, and must instead do my best to educate and advocate against their wider adoption. I am picking my battles, and this is one of them.

My thoughts on the subject are too long to comfortably detail in one post, and so I will be uploading them in parts as I finish writing. I have written these with the assumption that people have a base understanding of concepts including the blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs — the _Web3 is Going Just Great_ [glossary](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/glossary) may be a useful resource if a term is unfamiliar.
