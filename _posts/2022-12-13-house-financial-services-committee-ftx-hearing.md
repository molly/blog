  <p>Ray: "They put out statements that it was in the interest of Bahamian creditors, although our view is that it violated the automatic stay in bankruptcy."</p>

  Ray: "The process in The Bahamian islands is not a transparent process. We have opened up the ability to share everything we have with the Bahamian government, similar to how we share with other liquidators around the world not only in this case but in other cases. It's meant to be a very cooperative situation. The pushback that we've gotten is sort of extraordinary in the context of bankruptcy. It raises questions, it seems irregular to me, there's lots of questions on our part, and obviously we're investigating."

It's been 14 years and the American public has heard lots of promises but has seen lots of ponzi schemes. For crypto, it's time to put up or shut up. It's worth noting that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark_Invest" target="_blank">Ark</a>, the innovation investor, several years ago identified five general-purpose technologies of the future: DNA sequencing, artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, and blockchain. And yet those first four 'disruptive technologies' have already delivered gamechanging innovation that affects my constituents in daily life. Blockchain has thus far delivered whitepapers and podcasts about Bitcoin and DAOs and NFTs, defi, and more, and it's all interesting—it's exciting even—but none of it has achieved product-market fit at scale. It's time for the blockchain investors and entrepreneurs to build things that matter, or to lose more credibility."
