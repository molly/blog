  <p>Sen. Toomey <span class="inserted-note">(R-PA)</span> says largely the opposite to Brown, and echoes the crypto industry's line that we must separate FTX's wrongdoing from all this promise that supposedly exists in the industry.</p>

  <p>First up is Professor Hilary Allen. Her statement is challenging crypto's claims they are decentralized. She has suggested that "a ban on crypto would be the most straightforward".</p>
  She says that if legislators are not willing to proceed with a ban, then they must be very careful not to enact laws that would make crypto "too big to fail".

  <p>Now Kevin O'Leary (note the laser eyes in the <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinolearytv" target="_blank">PFP</a>) is up. He was a paid spokesman of FTX. He's now listing his crypto entanglements, and talking them up ðŸ™„</p>
  <p>O'Leary echoing Toomey in his statements that Bitcoin "isn't a coin, it's software".</p>
  <p>This is a recently popular argument, which seems to seek to lean on "code as speech" precedence.</p>
  <p>O'Leary explaining how HE will be the one to do the detective work on what happened at FTX.</p>

  <p>McKenzie is outlining how he does not believe that cryptocurrencies are currencies, and how he believes that every cryptocurrency is a security.</p>
  "In my opinion, the cryptocurrency industry represents the largest Ponzi scheme in history."

  The argument, a common one, is that Bitcoin is too decentralized to be classed as a security.

  <p>Hilary Allen explains how "proof of reserves" and other crypto industry attestations don't replace proper auditing.<//p>
  Allen also says that arguments that crypto needs to be regulated completely differently from existing systems because "it's decentralized" doesn't hold water, and explains how the Bitcoin software and mining pools are highly centralized.

  <p>Sen. Tester <span class="inserted-note">(D-MT)</span> opens with skepticism, asks Allen how her concerns expressed in front of the Senate <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/stablecoins-how-do-they-work-how-are-they-used-and-what-are-their-risks" target="_blank">last year</a> have developed.</p>
  <p>Allen expresses her gratefulness that banking regulators have largely siloed crypto, and limited FTX's explosion from affecting traditional finance.</p>
  <p>But she expresses concerns over how crypto and traditional banking are increasingly intermingling, and she says we need to "firm up" the separation between the two.</p>
  "We have to think about how much of this we're willing to tolerate in the name of innovation."

  <p>Allen explains how the subprime mortgage crisis exposure was around $1.3T, and the reduction in the crypto industry "market cap" (which she also expresses skepticism about) was on that order, so if crypto and tradfi had not been segregated, its failure could've been catastrophic.</p>
  Sen. Tester asks if, had the two been closely coupled, the government might have had to bail out crypto like it had to bail out banks in 2008. Allen says yes.
