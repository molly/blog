In the beginning of February, I made a commitment to myself to read at least two articles a week pertaining to diversity, inclusion, and belonging (DI&B). I believe constant learning on these topics, and their intersection with the technology industry, is not optional and is key to being both a good manager and team member, but also to being a conscientous participant in the industry.

I have been maintaining a private list of these articles, along with a brief summary, but realized it might be useful to others looking to do the same thing to publish my list here. I will continue to update it as I read more, though because it is much easier for me to take private notes than update this page, it may lag behind somewhat.

I care very much about making sure I am consuming a representative and wide range of topics in this area, and so welcome suggestions and recommendations! If you know of anything I ought to be reading, please [send it my way](https://www.mollywhite.net/contact).

## February 1â€“5
* ["Hidden Curriculum"](https://www.edglossary.org/hidden-curriculum/). July 13, 2015 in _The Glossary of Education Reform_.
  * There are lessons and perspectives that students learn in schools (at all levels) that are unofficial and often unacknowledged, and sometimes mirror or contradict a school's stated values. These lessons shape students' perspectives and learnings in different ways, both positive and negative.
* ["The Pinterest Paradox: Cupcakes and Toxicity"](https://medium.com/digital-diplomacy/the-pinterest-paradox-cupcakes-and-toxicity-57ed6bd76960) by Francoise Brougher. August 11, 2020 in _Digital Diplomacy_.
  * Francoise Brougher's story of the toxic culture at Pinterest, and some really actionable suggestions on how to be a company that walks the walk when it comes to gender diversity. She later won a large lawsuit against Pinterest for gender discrimination.
