In the beginning of February, I made a commitment to myself to read at least two articles a week pertaining to diversity, inclusion, and belonging (DI&B). I believe constant learning on these topics, and their intersection with the technology industry, is not optional and is key to being both a good manager and team member, but also to being a conscientous participant in the industry.

I have been maintaining a private list of these articles, along with a brief summary, but realized it might be useful to others looking to do the same thing to publish my list here. I will continue to update it as I read more, though because it is much easier for me to take private notes than update this page, it may lag behind somewhat.

I care very much about making sure I am consuming a representative and wide range of topics in this area, and so welcome suggestions and recommendations! If you know of anything I ought to be reading, please [send it my way](https://www.mollywhite.net/contact).

## March 1–5
* "[Ignoring The History Of Anti-Asian Racism Is Another Form Of Violence](https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a35635188/anti-asian-racism-history-violence/)" by Connie Wun. March 1, 2021 in _Elle_.
  * Asian American history, including the wars that brought many Asian Americans to the US, is not taught or even acknowledged adequately. "As Dr. Mimi Kim, who works on community accountability and transformative justice, once said about the Korean War and its impacts: 'The violence is also in the forgetting.'" There is a myth that Asian Americans are unaffected by white supremacy, which is very much not the case.

* "[The George Floyd Act wouldn't have saved George Floyd’s life. That says it all](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/04/the-george-floyd-act-wouldnt-have-saved-george-floyds-life-thats-says-it-all)" by Derecka Purnell. March 4, 2021 in _The Guardian_.
  * The George Floyd Act, which bans police from using chokeholds, would not have saved George Floyd, who did not die from the use of a chokehold. "\[Police\] can show up and attempt to stop the crime, but they can’t stop the underlying conditions that give rise to it: class exploitation and poverty. Floyd appeared to need cash, not the police." The author is also critical of Democrats for taking performative actions without championing meaningful changes.

* "[Steve Martinez Jailed Again After Refusing To Testify Before A Federal Grand Jury](https://itsgoingdown.org/steve-martinez-jailed-again-after-refusing-to-testify-before-a-federal-grand-jury/)" by Ryan Fatica. March 4, 2021 in _It's Going Down_.
  * Water protector Steve Martinez is back in custody and faces up to 18 months incarceration for refusing to testify in a grand jury investigation related to the DAPL project and resistance to it. He was previously incarcerated for almost three weeks. "Federal grand juries have long been used as a way of punishing activists and gaining information that law enforcement can use to charge those participating in social movements with crimes."

## February 22–26
* "[Covid Vaccine Websites Violate Disability Laws, Create Inequity for the Blind](https://khn.org/news/article/covid-vaccine-websites-violate-disability-laws-create-inequity-for-the-blind/)" by Lauren Weber and Hannah Recht. February 25, 2021 in Kaiser Health News.
  * Nearly all vaccine websites across the country do not meet standards required by disability rights laws, and have prevented some blind and visually impaired from signing up online for vaccination appointments. Blind people are at a higher risk for COVID-19 because they are often unable to distance from people, due to needing assistance with things like grocery shopping.

## February 8–12
* "[Why Being Black Feels So Overwhelming Right Now](https://medium.com/@effiegabriella/why-it-feels-so-overwhelming-right-now-6d2ee308f3b7)" by Gabriella Effie Forson. June 1, 2020 on Medium.
  * Forson writes about the challenges of going about life as though it were "business as usual" in the summer of 2020, with a powerful analogy. She also describes the dissonance of seeing white people posting online as though things were normal, and lists some actions people can take. "Don’t shy away because you think it doesn’t concern you. If you love a black person or believe in equality this concerns you."
* "[Letter and symbol misrecognition in highly legible typefaces for general, children, dyslexic, visually impaired and ageing readers](https://typography.guru/journal/letters-symbols-misrecognition/)" by Thomas Bohm. May 2019 in _Typography Journal_
  * Review of research on characters that are easily confused with other characters, and what typeface changes (for example, serifs) have been shown to increase peoples' ability to distinguish them. Also discusses the existence of "infant characters", a term I'd never heard: "Infant characters, a, g, l, q, y, I, J, 1, 4, 7, 9, are characters specifically designed for people around 6 years old." Goes into some detail about how different visual impairments cause different effects (for example, tunnel vision vs. blurry patches vs. poorer vision at the center of one's field of view). Some of the recommendations in the article were surprising to me: "Sans serif or bracketed serif was preferred over serif. It appears that a slight degree of serif which accentuates the characters ends without distracting from the simple form actually increased legibility."

## February 1–5
* "[Hidden Curriculum](https://www.edglossary.org/hidden-curriculum/)". July 13, 2015 in _The Glossary of Education Reform_.
  * There are lessons and perspectives that students learn in schools (at all levels) that are unofficial and often unacknowledged, and sometimes mirror or contradict a school's stated values. These lessons shape students' perspectives and learnings in different ways, both positive and negative.

* "[The Pinterest Paradox: Cupcakes and Toxicity](https://medium.com/digital-diplomacy/the-pinterest-paradox-cupcakes-and-toxicity-57ed6bd76960)" by Francoise Brougher. August 11, 2020 in _Digital Diplomacy_.
  * Francoise Brougher's story of the toxic culture at Pinterest, and some really actionable suggestions on how to be a company that walks the walk when it comes to gender diversity. She later won a large lawsuit against Pinterest for gender discrimination.
