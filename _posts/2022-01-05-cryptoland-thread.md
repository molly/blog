  an up-and-coming crypto scam—er, project—has managed to dunk on cryptobros better than any satirist i've seen so far,
  with one of the most painful-to-watch youtube videos i've seen in a while. join me in hell as we watch this together:

  the video begins with a montage of men bro-hugging and clinking beers, with not a woman in sight. they seem to have
  taken inspiration from
  <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=mz5kY3RsmKo" target="_blank">the Fyre Festival promo</a>, but maybe they couldn't
  afford the hot models?

  they tout their 60 parcels of 1 acre each, with careful wording that visionary investors will "acquire land" (despite
  later portions of the video, which show a guy turning up to a fully-built mansion on what appears to be much more than
  an acre)

  we cut away from the island rendering now to
  <a href="https://twitter.com/kyle_chasse" target="_blank">@kyle_chasse</a> on a zoom video hyping the project, clearly

  evidently people on this island permanently have the overexcited energy of awkward convention-goers meeting fellow
  nerds who get their in-jokes for the first time, because they're standing on a dock yelling "honeybadger don't care!"
  and "we are going to make it!"

  the keys to christopher's mansion say "not your keys, not your bitcoin" on the keychain. "where do you come up with
  these crazy ideas?" he asks. connie looks in the direction of a flushing toilet sound. at this point i was strongly
  wondering if this was satire.

  "i'm still amazed by the success of the cryptolanders NFT collection", says christopher. i assume this statement is
  also set in some far-future where the island also actually exists, because the NFT collection he mentions is currently
  enjoying lukewarm success at most

  it's another dime-a-dozen generated NFT, this one based on the "connie" mascot. they're... not great. the average
  price for one of these babies over the past 90 days was 0.15 ETH, or $575. not exactly buying-an-island-in-fiji money.

  now they're in a room in a casino full of people playing air hockey. everyone pictured appears to be male, except for
  a waitress who is being painfully hit on by a man in a pepe the frog shirt. this may be the most realistic part of the

  apparently, the island that they're planning on using for this is Nananu-i-cake, in Fiji.<br/><br/>Looks like a nice place.
  Except it's a tiny island. Not even a mile across it's widest part.<br/><br/>And.... some people live there already.

  "Masterplan.pdf" includes plans for staff lockers, break room, etc. but there are no staff accommodations. This
  presumably means that staff will not stay on the island, which I'm sure will go just fine when one of those Fiji
  storms blows through and they can't get to work.

      <img alt="Instagram message exchange with Bartosz Domiczek First message is cut off; begins: 'project out there - cryptoland.is - which claims that you helped work on and produce concept art, and that you are affiliated with the project. While I would be remiss if that were true, because being a part of ponzi schemes and fraudulently trying to attract investors is never cool - I have a feeling that the work highlighted in the video is not yours.' Reply: 'Hi! Thanks for letting me know. I did some concepts for them a few years ago but I am not affiliated with this project whatsoever. I will request them to take down my name from the site.'" draggable="true" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FIgXlWNXoAYsToD?format=jpg&name=large" />

  </a>apparently cryptoland, a project entirely based on the "ideology" of crypto, goes running to centralized interventions when it suits them.

  fortunately decentralized services have existed since long before web3, and someone seems to have re-uploaded it to <a href="https://peertube.social/w/iHHqNQvf3h9NW8Hu6ejg4H" target="_blank">peertube</a>

  </a> i wonder why this project suddenly no longer wants people to watch the video they spent so much time and money on?<br/><br/>the video is also available on the wayback machine, though their player can be slow and they are more susceptible to takedowns: (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220107005114/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHopGox5cU" target="_blank">link</a>)

  </a> as a little treat, the lovely and undoubtedly extremely attractive person who uploaded the video to peertube also shared this extended cut of the animation (nearly twice as long) in case anyone truly wishes to torture themselves: (<a href="https://peertube.social/w/nzEJmpNEpTmxfoae1MN8jW">link</a>)

  </a> i'm wondering if the founders are trying to distance themselves from the project in taking down this video but not the one w just the animation. that's what they did with another project that went up in flames after they doxxed someone (see <a href="https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1478515283291693059" target="_blank">previous tweet</a>)

  </a> if so, they probably wouldn't want people to see this extremely self-indulgent "Cryptoland founders" video they made: (<a href="https://peertube.social/w/w88Xz8DZQDVAzcLqZM8s8d" target="_blank">link</a>)
