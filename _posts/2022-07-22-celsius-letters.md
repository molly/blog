_Trigger warning: Discussions of suicide._

People with funds locked in Celsius Network have been sending letters to the judge presiding over the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. These are excerpts from those letters.

It's important to understand that schemes like this in the cryptocurrency industry are hurting real people who are often suffering losses they can't afford. Regardless of what you may believe about individuals' decisions to put significant amounts of money into Celsius, blame lies with the executives creating and running these companies and with the U.S. legal and regulatory system for allowing companies like this to operate.

The goal of highlighting these excerpts is to illustrate this, and shed some light on how people are convinced to put their money into projects like Celsius. Celsius may have been one of the first companies to collapse in the 2022 crypto crash, but it is hardly unique.

All case filings can be viewed on [Stretto](https://cases.stretto.com/Celsius/court-docket/). Individual letters are linked alongside their excerpts. I have published similar excerpts [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1550160830762782724), and will be continuing to update that thread and this post as new letters are entered. New letters will go at the top of this post, which is in reverse order based on docket number.

If anyone is looking to submit a letter of their own, [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CelsiusNetwork/comments/w2x7f2/how_to_submit_a_letter_to_the_judge_and_contact/) seems to explain how.

## Background
On June 12, 2022, the cryptocurrency lending firm Celsius Network suspended customer withdrawals, swaps, and transfers. On July 13, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Users have been unable to withdraw crypto stored in Celsius accounts. Users with loans open are still having to add collateral to maintain their loans, despite not knowing if they'll be able to retrieve their collateral. Some have been forcibly liquidated even though they intended to add collateral to open loans, due to needing to go through the overloaded Celsius support team.

Celsius offered both "Earn" and "Custody" accounts. With Earn accounts, users received a percentage rate of return either in the $CEL token or in the same tokens they were holding. In April 2022, Celsius stopped allowing non-accredited investors in the United States to keep Earn accounts, in order to comply with U.S. regulations. With Custody accounts, coins are stored and could be transferred, swapped, or used for loan collateral, but did not accumulate the rewards of the Earn accounts.

[Doc 213](https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174907262280000000081.pdf), filed July 23, 2022:

I am a crypto investor in Celsius Platform, resident and citizen of India. Ever since Celsius has blocked the withdrawals and transfers of currency, I lost the access to my 3.15 Bitcoin <span class="inserted-note">[~$71,500 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_price">date of filing</a>]</span> which were invested on this platform across 2 accounts. This money is my lifetime saving and my families and my future were depending on it. I chose Celsius as they often claimed to be very secure and an alternative to a bank, but I was wrong. There may be investors who lost much more than me, but for me these 3.15 Bitcoin mean half of a lifetime, something I could never afford or imagine to lose.

> My mother died from Multiple Myeloma (blood cancer) in 2018 and I was a beneficiary of her Trust. I used most of that inherited money to buy bitcoin and a few altcoins in 2019. After seeing Celsius advertised on Youtube channels and after reading about Mashinsky, I decided to move my crypto into a Celsius Earn account so I could earn interest on my crypto. It was a modest amount of interest. About $25 per week in interest payments but I trusted this was the right move. I’m 56 years old. Alex Mashinsky has bankrupted my retirement.

> I could go on for several more pages about how we investors were lied to, misled, tricked and defrauded, and how Mashinsky and his friends looted the investor’s crypto, took insanely risky bets with our crypto, and tried to launder money through an Israeli crime ring but I have exhausted my desire to live. My passing is 100% the fault of Alex Mashinsky. Mashinsky and his crime ring have stolen over $60,000 from me.

> I am a retail investor with asset valuing approximately $32,200 on the Celsius platform. This sum might not mean much to some people, but it constitutes about half my life savings and has dire implications for myself and my family.

> The deposit amount consists of savings of both my parents and my savings from a combined working history of over 65 years. The emotional and mental stress that I have suffered from having my deposits frozen is considerable and I am trying to keep myself from falling into a deeper mental and emotional hole. Suffering from chronic back pain since eighteen years old-over 35 years and no longer having access to my deposits, I have applied for welfare to make ends meet in the future since employment prospects are minimal with my condition and age.

> I am a retired senior citizen of the USA. I saw no opportunity to earn interest on my life savings in a traditional bank and inflation is at record highs. I trusted Celsius to give me a reasonable rate of return on my life’s savings of about 5%, which I hold in stable coin, BTC and ETH. I own no CEL. I was mislead by Mr. M, who said that Celsius loans were over collateralized and that my money was safe. Now, I am facing financial ruin. Please do whatever is possible to save depositors’ money and please allow us to benefit from increases in crypto prices that will surely come at some point in the future. In the meantime, I pray for all of us who are suffering financially and emotionally because of Mr. M. The mental pressure is almost unbearable. The actions of Mr. M. have created unspeakable misery for many people and I am sure will result in suicides. I’m crying as I write this and feel sorry for us all. I would appreciate anything you can do to help make us whole.

> I write to you to let you know the devastating impact that Celsius is having on my life. My husband and I put in a combined amount of $138,000 USD into Celsius trusting their intent and care for customers. The thought of losing that amount of money is horrifying. That was our life savings. It was our chance of having a baby, and funding medical expenses. It was our chance of taking care of our parents as they age. Since the halt of withdrawals, I have not been able to sleep or eat properly. I have been emotionally distressed which is impacting my marriage and my life. I feel like I just cannot get up each day and keep going. My mother, who passed away of cancer when I was 19, left me with some money that I put into Celsius. If I do not get that back, I will end my life as the loss will impact my family and I significantly.

> My aunt is a 72 year old domestic helper. She’s been working all her life to support her family while taking care of mine. Specifically, she's been working with my family for the last 33 years. Needless to say a domestic helper’s salary barely covers living expenses for her family, yet alone savings. As a sign of gratitude, I created a Celsius account for her as a way to build and grow her retirement fund so she can go back to her home country and live her remaining year in relative comfort, as she deserves.

> From small monthly deposits, and a few lucky decisions later, he account grew to USD40k in slightly under 2 years. This made her a millionaire back home which allows her to live a decade (based on life expectancy) in great comfort, the ideal retirement. She was due to retire in August 2022 and I was only planning to pull assets out of her account in mid August.

> Needless to say, I now can’t withdraw assets from Celsius and she no longer has a comfortable retirement to look forward to. She continues to be employed by my family which we are more than happy to have her. But at 72, and weeks from retirement, I cannot begin to imagine how debilitatingly disappointed she must feel.

> I have most of my long term savings, including a downpayment for a house in California, which is a significant amount tied up in Celsius, because since day 1 I believed that everything is all backed up, deposits are safe, there is enough collateral and so on. How can you face your spouse and tell her that all the savings and the downpayment for the house are gone?

> I live in United States of America, one of the greatest nations in this world, we are not in some 3rd world country swamped with corruption on all levels, and people robbing people on the streets as a profession. Why wasn't Celsius overseen by the necessary institutions, I'm sure to get a licenses to operate the way Celsius has, there are government institutions that must oversee those balance sheets, the loans, the money, the lending. How is it even possible that a company gambles away billions of dollars, because it's growing too fast and betting on a future where crypto currency value only grows in the short and long term, now this is extremely risky. Where was the oversight?

> I had 95% of my life savings in Celsius as I was made to believe that it was a safe and secure account where I could earn 1% interest on my bitcoin. I had 21.7 of them <span class="inserted-note">[~AU$705,000, ~US$493,000 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_price">date of filing</a>]</span> in their across 3 accounts.

> I have less than $30k now in my bank account, I have more than $330k AUD owning to the Australian Tax Office, and I have a $1.19m mortgage that is about to explode to a 16% interest rate because I will very soon be defaulting on my payment.

> I have suicidal thoughts and the only reason I hadn't already taken my life was the burden that would leave my family, and I have lost 15% of my body weight in 6 weeks from the stress of suddenly losing everything that i've spent my entire life building. Worst of all, my mother split my home with me so if I default on the home she'll be homeless at 60 years of age with no other savings and her rock bottom to a place with no out will be on my hands and I just don't see a way where I can recover.

> I personally have around 10/15 thousand US dollars worth of assets sitting on Celsius at the moment, which I have been blocked from withdrawing. This is a reasonable amount of money for me and I've lost most of, if not all my crypto and savings. 

> Alex Mashinsky scammed me out of almost 0.4 BTC, along with some other coins too. I have lost the money i was saving towards a deposit on my own house. Alex has cost me a fortune while he enjoyed my funds to live the life of Larry, spouting lies and complete mistruths to obtain more money from investors to take outrageous risks with our money.

> At this moment, as I am writing this letter, and the current market conditions I have $23,653.98, which $13,024.05 is held in USDC stable coin. All my coins are held in the “Earn Account” b/c I was supposedly “Grandfathered In”, since I live in the United States and I’m not an Accredited Investor. I am a Single Father, Full-Time Dad, no breaks, and this is my life savings. I know it’s not much, but I was trying. With All money cryptocurrency locked up in Celsius this is taking a toll on my health, family, mentality, sleep, and any other emotion you could imagine.

> I had a plan. I am separating from the United States Military this week. I had saved over $100,000 which I deposited in Celsius Network in 2021, primarily as USDC. That money was set aside to support me through my post-military education. It took me decades of sacrifice to save that money. Like so many other people, the fund lock-up at Celsius has had a downward spiral impact on my life and I have had to borrow money from family just to make ends meet.

> I am a small depositor – an 84 year old widow on social security. The deposit was my life savings to pay for home care when I'm no longer able to care for myself. I don't have years to wait for my saving to be returned. I made this decision after I watched the terrible care my husband received in a rehab hospital that also was a nursing home.
> My time on the platform was just over one month, and I took no loans. My assets were 1.46621 BTC <span class="inserted-note">[~$33,300 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_price">date of filing</a>]</span>, 7.748 ETH <span class="inserted-note">[~$12,400 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_price">date of filing</a>]</span>, and 50 LTC <span class="inserted-note">[~$2,800 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_price">date of filing</a>]</span>-a tiny amount compared to the vast amounts other may have lost.

> I am an Irish/Australian retail crypto depositor into the earn account. I am 42 years old and have a 4 year old child. For the last 2 years I have been steadily purchasing Bitcoin and Ethereum with a firm belief in the ecosystem and its possibilities. I am a refrigeration mechanic/electrician working in the large commercial industry. My job involves very heavy lifting, working in extreme weather conditions here in the far north Queensland tropics and very long hours given the lack of people in my sector up here. The plan was to work a ridiculous amount of hours and live in a very cheap run down property to maximise savings. The end game was to buy a house for myself and my child. I have no family over here and nobody to fall back on so I had to come up with a plan. I have lost everything. How can I explain this to my son? I feel ashamed at myself.

> I feel really betrayed from Alex Mashinsky and his company Celsius. He published so many videos in the last two years about how good Celsius is, that all customers are protected because of a high insurance from Celsius. Mr Mashinsky also said that the funds of customers are always accessible. I have over $76000 US Dollar worth of funds on Celsius...

[Doc 175](https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174907252280000000068.pdf), filed July 22, 2022:

> I too, was led to believe that Celsius was the “safest, most transparent home for crypto”, and for that reason held almost the entirety of my assets with them - emphasis on past tense.

> Now, I am presently in a position whereby I can’t make rent and I am well behind with my tax savings as I had entrusted them to look after my funds. I am in major need of money and feeling somewhat helpless, especially as a small holder; powerless.

> I was a keen purchaser of and believer in Luna Classic – for a decentralised future - before its collapse and for the seasons stated above, also kept 100% of my Luna (equating to 85% of my cryptocurrency wealth) with Celsius. Following the de-pegging of UST and the collapse of Luna I was desperate and resentful, as well as having the overwhelming feeling of stupidity on my own part.

> However, all was not lost as I still had money – worth roughly $1300 today – on Celsius, which may be pennies to some but would drag me from the hole I find myself in. I am particularly interested in my 770 MATIC <span class="inserted-note">[~$700 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_price">date of filing</a>]</span>, which again wouldn’t be worth writing about for most, but to me represents a chance at a better future for myself and a chance to eventually begin to average into that asset once more with the hope of being in a better financial situation in years to come.

> As things stand, I have roughly 100 Euro in my bank account with a personal loan of 130 to repay monthly, and no means to even make the rest up. As mentioned before with my tax savings, I am in the first year of self-employment so things are very, very hard anyway. The jump, believe it or not, was due to the fact that I had managed to accumulate almost $15000 with Luna and therefore had a ‘safety blanket’ to see me through the opening stages of my new adventure, yet here I am.

> I have been a Celsius Network customer since 3 rd March 2022. My husband and I each have a Celsius account, and I also have an account for my self managed super fund. In total we deposited circa $240,000 AUD of crypto assets to the Celsius Network, which is a significant portion of our life’s savings and retirement fund.

> I have a history of mental health issues (anxiety, stress, depression) and this event has caused me significant distress.

> I am 59 and I put close to $300,000 into Celsius (nearly my life savings), most of which was in USDC. At the time I believed that since USDC was a stable coin backed by actual dollars, my money was safe.

> I feel deceived by Alex Mashinsky who on weekly AMAs repeatedly declared that our funds were safe and would be protected by Celsius. I accept responsibility for not reading the Terms and Conditions more carefully, but I could not believe that what Alex was saying on a constant basis would be so clearly contradicted by the Terms and Conditions. Alex repeatedly sold and presented Celsius as a low risk savings account.

> I started giving possession of my Crypto to Celsius to gain the yields from staking in Dec 2021. I did some research and amongst many positive reviews one of the attractive reasons was Alex Mashinsky’s AMA’s statements saying;

> - If something bad happened with Celsius deployment, will Celsius stand behind it? Yep! That’s where companies are tested”

> I have recently retired after serving 34 years in the Fire Service, I retired out after having a heart attack. If my body did not give up I would still be on the floor serving my community. But that’s not how it worked. Once I retired I realized that whatever savings (457) I had, I had better treat with the utmost caution. After looking at our financial landscape, particularly over the last few years and watching how our government chose to handle it, my Econ 101 kicked in and I realized we (collective we) we’re heading down the inflation road and a crash similar to 2008. In 2008 I lost over 40% of my 457, and at this stage in my life I couldn’t endure that financial hit again. So after some research and having a very tech savvy son, I became interested in crypto currency, more specifically “Block-chain” technology. ... Initially I placed my 150 Etherium crypto <span class="inserted-note">[~$229,000 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_price">date of filing</a>]</span> and 47,000 Cardano (ADA) <span class="inserted-note">[~$23,000 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/cardano_price">date of filing</a>]</span> into “Block-Fi” and held my crypto for 1 year with no issues, then I received advertisement for Celsius. ...

> Well I had an unexpected event. Carpet in my house got ruined. The carpet was growing mold and making myself and family sick. So we had to replace it before we ended up in the hospital from constantly breathing in mold. I had to sell some of my retirement investments in order to pay for the carpet. Had I had the savings that I transferred to Celsius, I would not have had to dip into my retirement funds.

> I also had a long weekend vacation planned. I was going to use my savings to pay for it. Again I had to sell retirement investments to pay for the vacation.

> I also sold $50,000 from my retirement investments and put them into Celsius. It took me years and years to save that money. Not sure if Ill ever get that back.

> At the time of this letter I have over $99,000 with Celsius. $50,000 being from retirement and $49,000 being my personal savings.

You may be thinking that I deserve this and I’ve should have gotten out before Celsius paused withdrawals. Maybe so. But I hope there is a part of you that sees many people losing out on their investments/life savings. It’s a real shame that this happened to people who like myself are just trying to improve their quality of life by increasing their net worth.

> I saw Celsius advertisement and promotion through media and deposited my cryptos which I purchase at the top price from Coinbase Pro last December. My cryptos on the Celsius are maybe not big money for Mr. Mashinsky and his high salaried staffs ($30,000 monthly income after filing Chapter 11), but it is huge amount of money for my poor family. Like many other depositors, I and my family are severely impacted both in financial and mental health by the bankruptcy and locked up cryptos. I always check the app if my cryptos are still there. I can’t focus my job or sleep.
> I deposited my cryptos on the Celsius because they always claim that Celsius is SAFER than traditional banks or even other Crypto companies through the medias.

I made a respectable profit and decided that I wanted to start a nest egg with the 7 Ethereum (valued at approximately $25k at the time) that I had earned through my trading efforts. Through a recommendation of a friend I came across Celsius. I reviewed their web site and began doing research by watching their AMA's and reading reviews on the internet.

> I'm writing in regards to Celsius Network and their practices that have left my family and I in dark times. I joined Celsius Network earlier in the year and had deposited $15,000. Everything I had remaining for a purchase of a home for my two children and wife here in SouthWest Florida. I trusted Celsius so explicitly due to Alex Mashinsky constantly broadcasting what I thought were truths and axioms that the company and himself lived by. How clearly I was wrong. I took out a $1,000 and $5,000 loan and was unable to add necessary collateral to two margin calls that were enacted during their pause of transfers and withdrawals. The collateral was available and ready, only to watch nearly the entirety of my crypto evaporate away with no recourse to solve. I feel absolutely disgusted with what has since unfolded.

Also, my aunt is seriously ill and needs my financial support for her major operation (please refer to screenshots provided below). However, all of my savings have been tied up in the Celsius network. I was planning to withdraw from Celsius to fund my birth and my aunt's operation in late June, but due to the withdrawal halt, I don't have access to any funds and my life has become so miserable now. I am worried that my stress due to Celsius's situation will affect the health of my unborn child. Also, my two other children are still in primary ages and my family also need to fund locked in Celsius for their education.

Quotes that where said every week for over a year: "The worst thing that can happen is that everyone gets their coins back", "We have 2billion dollars on our balance sheet so there is zero risk in depositing your crypto on Celsius.", "Celsius is transparent and shares all of it's financial data.", "Celsius is safer than holding your money in the bank.", "Celsius will take full responsibility and will make sure depositors are always prioritized.", "Celsius is more regulatory compliant than all of it's competitors."

> I'm a Celsius depositor. My account balance is in the mid six figure range. The balance was in the seven figure range last year when cryptocurrency prices were at their peak.

> I consider myself to be "above average" in terms of understanding financial markets, as I hold an economics degree, but I am by no means an expert. The primary reason I was comfortable with Celsius was because Alex Mashinsky repeatedly stated on numerous youtube "AMAs (ask mashinsky anything)" and interviews that the yield paid on our cryptocurrency deposits was generated with overcollateralized lending. While I am no financial guru, to me, overcollateralization meant that if a debtor could not meet their obligations that Celsius would liquidate the posted collateral and ensure that the lent crypto holdings were retained.

> While I am fortunate to continue to be able to support my family despite this mishap, I worry about the financially vulnerable individuals who put their life savings into Celsius because they were encouraged to do so by Alex Mashinsky, despite the fact that he knew that the company was struggling from a financial standpoint. Single mothers, retirees, and other vulnerable individuals absolutely need their savings back.

> I am one of the many customers affected by these proceedings with a large portion of my savings...

> [B]eginning on 13 June 2022, I was stonewalled into having a loan with Celsius liquidated. This was primarily due to Celsius freezing transfers which took away all ability for users to manage their loans on their own. This forced users to rely on their support team, which was not able to react in time. Celsius froze transfers on 12 June 2022 and directed customers to contact support in order to resolve a margin call, advertising a 24-48 hour response time. On 13 June 2022, I received notification of a margin call and e-mailed support attempted to call their customer support line only to sit on hold for 4 hours only to be hung up on. My loan was liquidated on 18 June 2022. The first time I heard back from Celsius regarding this matter was 21 June, 8 days after initial contact, saying nothing can be done about it now. I requested a refund of the liquidation fee to show a sign of good faith to the customers only to be ignored again.
