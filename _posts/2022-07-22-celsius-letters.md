_Content warning: Discussions of suicide._

People with funds locked in Celsius Network have been sending letters to the judge presiding over the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. These are excerpts from those letters.

It's important to understand that schemes like this in the cryptocurrency industry are hurting real people who are often suffering losses they can't afford. Regardless of what you may believe about individuals' decisions to put significant amounts of money into Celsius, blame lies with the executives creating and running these companies and with the U.S. legal and regulatory system for allowing companies like this to operate.

The goal of highlighting these excerpts is to illustrate this, and shed some light on how people are convinced to put their money into projects like Celsius. Celsius may have been one of the first companies to collapse in the 2022 crypto crash, but it is hardly unique.

All case filings can be viewed on [Stretto](https://cases.stretto.com/Celsius/court-docket/). Individual letters are linked alongside their excerpts. I have published similar excerpts [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1550160830762782724), and will be continuing to update that thread and this post as new letters are entered. New letters will go at the top of this post, which is in reverse order based on docket number.

If anyone is looking to submit a letter of their own, [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CelsiusNetwork/comments/w2x7f2/how_to_submit_a_letter_to_the_judge_and_contact/) seems to explain how.

## Background
On June 12, 2022, the cryptocurrency lending firm Celsius Network suspended customer withdrawals, swaps, and transfers. On July 13, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Users have been unable to withdraw crypto stored in Celsius accounts. Users with loans open are still having to add collateral to maintain their loans, despite not knowing if they'll be able to retrieve their collateral. Some have been forcibly liquidated even though they intended to add collateral to open loans, due to needing to go through the overloaded Celsius support team.

Celsius offered both "Earn" and "Custody" accounts. With Earn accounts, users received a percentage rate of return either in the $CEL token or in the same tokens they were holding. In April 2022, Celsius stopped allowing non-accredited investors in the United States to keep Earn accounts, in order to comply with U.S. regulations. With Custody accounts, coins are stored and could be transferred, swapped, or used for loan collateral, but did not accumulate the rewards of the Earn accounts.

> I am a 65 year old retired man writing this letter in the hopes that justice will be served for myself and many others who have lost their investments. The majority of my life savings were deposited in Celsius with the understanding my funds were secure. The rest of my life has been drastically changed because of of the misinformation and outright deception by Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky.
>
> I have worked since I was 15 years old, and have saved my earnings, sacrificing and pinching pennies for the last 50 years. Now, upon retirement I have found that most of my savings are being withheld from me by Celsius- just two weeks after my new marriage! Just as our honeymoon began with high hopes for the future, news came that my funds had been frozen. Since that fateful day (June 12, 2022) I have felt devastated and betrayed. The outcome of this case will have enormous long-term consequences for me, my family and my overall state of mind.

I worked over 4 years to build up that amount and I trusted Alex with my lifesavings. As I’m sure you’ve heard from numerous customers, Alex had weekly AMAs and just days before freezing customer accounts, advised customers that everything was fine and there should be no problems withdrawing money. Telling customers, they were not making risky trades and that Celsius was safer than a bank account. This ended up not being the truth. As a licensed police officer who helps victims of fraud, I don’t see how this is any different than what happened with Enron.

> Currently, I have about $3,500 worth of BTC in my Celsius account. I will be okay and it won’t break me. But, I encouraged my father-in-law and mother to submit crypto to Celsius. They have a total of about $7,500 worth of crypto locked in Celsius. That is what really bothers me… I led my relatives down this path and I will pay them back every cent. But, this is truly a dishonest thing done by Alex and the Celsius team. They have ruined many lives and I pray to God that nobody has committed suicide over this.

> I am a customer who unfortunately trusted Celsius. I have sold all my stocks, withdrew all my savings and refinance my house to invest in Celsius for the future of my family and my own. In many interviews and articles, Alex consistently ensured and convinced everyone that Celsius was a transparent and legitimate option for long term life investments. Constantly advertising themselves to be a superior options to banks, this misdirection has caused myself and many others to befall a serious financial crisis in the middle of this economic downturn.

> I am a 69yo, widow, who deposited my crypto into Celsius. BTC 4 <span class="inserted-note">[~$91,300 on <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/">date of filing</a>]</span>, Eth 15 <span class="inserted-note">[~$24,300 on <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum/">date of filing</a>]</span>, Polygon 2200 <span class="inserted-note">[~$2,000 on <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/polygon/">date of filing</a>]</span>, etc., I understood the risk that the value could go down. The volatility of crypto currency is apparent. I didn’t sign up to be scammed, in a structured Ponzi scheme. I will never be able to accumulate any wealth at my age, I’m old. I will have to go back to work, if I can find work, if I can manage my health to be able to work. I cannot survive on $1500 a month social security check. The importance of this investment, would bridge the gap in my income for survival in high inflation and recession. The devastation to my life situation is irrepairable, its despair, hopelessness, its failure, a slow death, that eats at you every minute of every day. It takes your heart, mind, soul and body. I have become a shell of a person and obsess on how to fix it. Maybe I should go to the southern border and get a job. It’s crazy, I have never crossed to the dark side, but desperation can make you do and think strange things, especially when you are alone and in despair.

> Some of the Investors who invested with Celsius are the private-equity firms WestCap and the Canadian public-pension giant CDPQ which is one of the largest Pension Funds located in Montreal, Quebec Canada. CDPQ is valued at over $420 Billion dollars and has been in operation since 1965.
>
> Seeing that companies of this magnitude invested with Celsius gave me the indication that Celsius is a good safe investment. I say this because these companies went through an extensive due diligence process to ensure that Celsius’s books are what they claim them to be and that their business model is sound in order to ensure that they would be given a greater and better return than investing elsewhere and the risk level would be extremely low as per what was being preached by Celsius. These investors had access to company records, reports, balance sheets…that the average customer like myself would never have access to. Upon completion of their due diligence process CDPQ investied $150 Million dollars with Celsius which would be a good indication that Celsius is what it claims to have been or so they mislead everyone to believe. Alex Mashinsky did an interview with CNBC on April 13, 2022 where he mentioned that they just finished a $750 million dollar round of funding and how Celsius is fully transparent. These investors went through a thorough due diligence process and everything is what Celsius claims it to be.
>
>  I would like to provide you with an example of how some large Investors perform their due diligence process. There are a few Real Estate Moguls that I follow on Youtube by the names of Grant Cardone and Ben Mallah. Grant Cardone has a Real Estate portfolios worth about $3 Billion and Ben Mallah’s is around $250 million dollars. When Grant or Ben are looking to acquire Real Estate properties their “Modo” is that they let the banks do their due diligence process for them. ...
>
> How I came about to investing into Celsius over traditional investing options. I have a 22 month old daughter, my first born child, and with the money we received from her first birthday, Christmas, Easter and other holidays we had it sitting in a bank account and decided that instead of having it sit gaining 0% interest we should invest it for her schooling so when the time comes she has enough to afford it. We had appointments with a few banks and other fund managers on different types of investments we could put it in like government funding programs and so on and the rate that we would receive. Now some of these investments had restrictions on when the money could be taken out and for what purposes and any penalties that went along with that. I then came across Celsius and as I mentioned above seen it as a great investment and a much better one with no penalties for early withdrawal or restrictions on what the money could be used for. So based on my overall assessment of Celsius we decided to invest her money not knowing that we were being drawn into a “Ponzi” scheme if I can use that term. I am torn because the amount of money that I have invested is not something I can recoup back from working and saving especially with the economic situation we are all facing right now.

> First a little about me, I am an almost 50 year old laborer with a high school education working in a small shop in Salt Lake City. I have been scrimping and saving for over 10 years now trying to plan and prepare for some semblance of a retirement. During that time I was able to save approximately $165,000 which cost me much sacrifice and toil.
>
> I do not and have never owned my own home, I do not own a car, I shop at second hand stores to save money. I use the public transit system and a bicycle to commute. Just to give an idea of my extreme efforts to secure my future.
>
> After I learned about Bitcoin, crypto and eventually Celsius I became a real believer. This looked to me my best and possibly only shot at becoming a homeowner and retiree. So, I put some BTC and ETH in Celsius and began earning rewards, it was the first and only time I had ever experienced passive income. I went all in ... 100% of my savings followed by everything I had left over after each check.
>
> Once I started watching the AMAs (ask me anything) I became even more sold on Alex’s ideas and the Celsius mission. Told family and friends, convinced some coworkers to open accounts at Celsius. It was working and getting better all the time. Or so it seemed.
>
> As I type this letter my $165K investment is worth approximately $240K! More money than anyone in my family has ever had. At the top of the market my account exceeded $750K! Today it all seems so unreal and I lament my ignorance in all this.
>
> It’s very somber for me to look at my account knowing that I no longer have access to any of my savings and to hear all the heart wrenching stories like mine and worse.
>
> All this to say, I was fooled!... tricked by Alex in his AMAs where he assured me that my crypto was safe, safer than if it were held in a bank.

> I am writing to you in regards to the Celsius Network bankruptcy. I am 70 years old, retired and living on social security. In 2020 I opened an account with Celsius Network and deposited my Bitcoin and Etheiium into this account. It was my understanding that in return for depositing my coins with Celsius I would earn a certain percentage, paid out weekly in kind to my account. ...
>
> Loosing access to my funds has taken a toll on me physically and mentally. Your Honor, I have worked hard all my life and it has taken me years to save this money. I don't understand how this can be allowed to happen. Celsius Network was operating in New York and New Jersey which are under SEC rulings. The SEC has been so stringent regarding cryptocurrency regulations yet this was allowed to happen.

> I have a mid-six figure cash amount of cryptocurrency ($401,540.63 plus $231,518.35 collateral minus $150,000.00 loan - at today's prices) stored on the Celsius wallet along with a $150,000.00 USDC loan secured by 10.88 Bitcoin as collateral. ...
>
> The first issue is regarding my loan. After my account was frozen, Celsius began sending me emails that my collateral is close to being liquidated and that I need to send in $150,000.00 in either cash or USDC to payoff the loan so that my Bitcoin would not be liquidated. They told me that I could not use any cryptocurrency that I had on my account to pay the loan (because funds were frozen) and that I needed to send in fresh funds. I did not have $150,000.00 liquid, so I borrowed the money from my brother. He wired me $150,000.00 and I uploaded the funds to Coinbase to convert the funds to USDC to create a trail. Coinbase held the USDC for six days, then I was able to release the USDC to Celsius. During the six day waiting period, I was in communication with Celsius and they told me that there is a note on my account that the funds are on the way and my collateral would not be liquidated. Once the USDC arrived in my Celsius wallet, I was told that I was not close to liquidation of my collateral. Bitcoin was over $23,000.00 and my liquidation price was $17,223.12. I then asked for my USDC to be returned, since I didn't need to pay off the loan, and they told me that all transfers were frozen. I explained how my situation was different and then Celsius went silent. ...
>
> Every week they would be "bragging" how Celsius was growing and opening offices throughout the world, hiring top financial and technical minds (who they introduced in the AMAs) and how they were in desperate need of more engineers, etc. to handle their growth. They had a huge presence at this years Bitcoin Conference in Miami plus had a tremendous afterparty when the Bitcoin Conference was completed. It all sounded and seemed amazing. The "NEW WAY TO BANK". It now seems to be nothing but a Ponzi scheme where management gambled our investments away on risky cryptocurrency coins like LUNA along with derivatives, etc. and lost their shirts... our shirts. They had no right to do that. It is a criminal act.
>
> In these AMA chats, Alex Machinsky confidently described how "safe" our funds/property were in our Celsius wallets and that Celsius could immediately liquidate all funds/property to customers if necessary. That was an out and out lie and if every dollar is not returned to all customers, he should be criminally prosecuted for running a Ponzi scheme and I would be very happy to testify against him. If I don't receive my funds/property back, he will have destroyed my retirement.

Being a former housewife with very little social security coming to me, I worked for several years volunteering for overtime on my job to gain additional money to invest in cryptocurrencies. In hopes of having a retirement nest egg, I invested every portion of my income beyond living expenses. I trusted that Celsius was a safe place to store and protect my future retirement money. To now find out that my assets, which I worked so hard for over the past few years, may be lost due to mismanagement is devastating and like so many others, I often cannot sleep at night worrying how I will survive in the future.

> I am a beneficial owner of two Celsius accounts, one in my name ... and one in the name of an LLC I set up for my family's benefit... I am a US citizen and an accredited investor. I have never borrowed from Celsius. My funds were deployed on Celsius to earn yield. At the time Celsius paused withdrawals in mid-June, the total value across both accounts, expressed in US Dollar terms, was approximately $2,500,000. The bulk of the value is held in Bitcoin (BTC): I have about 100 BTC across the two Celsius accounts. Some Ethereum (ETH) and other assets make up the remainder.

> In my day-to-day life, I am a technology and life sciences entrepreneur and investor. I attended Harvard Law School, where I have since taught for some years in the fields of privacy and venture capital. After law school, I clerked for Chief Judge Danny J. Boggs of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the 2005-2006 term, but I am not a lawyer; I never took the bar, as my mother reminded me many times. ...
>
> By now you will be well aware that Mr. Mashinsky represented many times over the years, in public statements such as webinars, that Celsius was in a position of excellent financial health. You may also be interested to know that he made similar representations privately. For example, I sent him an email in June 2021 asking "Of course I read the rumors that Celsius has been 'endlessly rehypothecating.' Please tell me (us): are we safe with Celsius? You guys solid? Please give us a good, clear signal." He replied the next day saying "Yes you are safe. We are profitable and have no losses."

I relocated back to the UK after, over 20 years in abroad, just a few weeks before the Covid pandemic started and lockdown across the UK came into force. With the extreme isolation & lack of any social network I found myself somewhat desperate to change my situation and susceptible to financial advice given by Alex Mashinsky who presented himself as financial genius who has lead several billion dollar companies.

Promoted as safer than banks it gave me the opportunity to accumulate where my salary was unable contribute much. Along with a loan to buy more crypto that Alex Mashinsky on his YouTube channel advised was the best way to further grow wealth. I was lead to believe Celsius primarily generated profit from interest made in the lending business, the profits generated would then be paid to the community, the investors, as interest instead of to shareholders at a bank. This made sense to me and as all loans were said to be fully collateralized it appeared to be a safe and ethical business model.

I scraped this from various other wallets to safeguard the loan I had from getting liquidated after the BTC price dropped suddenly and after another loan (using my Cel tokens) got liquidated, costing me that entire balance. I intended to withdraw other crypto in my account, mainly my ETH and USDC balance, so as not to have all my eggs in one basket and leave me with some funds on hand. However it was late at that moment so to avoid a potential mistake processing a withdrawal when tired, I left that task till the following day. This next day however turned out to be the day they stopped all withdrawals; leaving me in the horrific position of having my entire wealth tied up in one account at Celsius. I am now penniless, with Celsius holding my entire life savings in the form of around 7 BTC <span class="inserted-note">[~$160,900]</span>, 62 ETH <span class="inserted-note">[~$105,000 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_price">date of filing</a>]</span> $7000 USDC and some smaller balances of other crypto tokens.

My heart sank when I found out that Celsius filed for bankruptcy and had halted all withdrawals. I am not allowed to access my family’s funds because of reckless decisions made by the leadership at Celsius who is still allowed to pay their employees 100% of their salaries and are even trying to be sure their executives get their bonuses. Their message to the stakeholders is their families matter more than we do and share no liability in this process which is not an amicable solution. Why is that allowed? Because they have a lifestyle to maintain? We all have life commitments and family members to take care of so I am asking the court to proceed without prejudice and ensure that the liability is shared with the leadership team including those with decision making authority at Celsius. I have 11,401.95 in Celsius and my wife has 332.46 and to some it may not seem like much but to us it was a large portion of our family savings allocated to certain financial buckets as stated above.

A day before Celsius halted withdrawals (Saturday June 11) I increased my collateral by $47,600 (34 ETH) to protect any liquidation risk and with the assumption I was dealing with an organization that was practicing an acceptable level of risk management when handling retail funds/loans. This increase in collateral could have been used to pay off the loan a long time ago if I was aware of the mismanagement of funds taking place at Celsius. This is the majority of my life savings, the impact of losing this money would have a profound negative impact to my life and the life of my two kids and partner.

> As a Celsius account holder with an initial principal balance of approximately $125,000 (of which I have withdrawn/transferred out $0 since my initial transfer into Celsius), a substantial portion of my life’s savings... It had taken me many years to be convinced enough to move a sizeable portion of my family’s savings from mutual funds into crypto. I purchased cryptocurrencies because I was made aware of Celsius Network, where I would have the opportunity to bank my cryptocurrencies somewhere that I could earn weekly interest, credited to my account in-kind, while holding for the long term... It was November 29, 2021 when I first started buying BTC, ETH, LINK, MATIC, and SNX and transferring it all into my Celsius account. I quickly got to a point where my family and I were satisfied by the amount of money we had parked in Celsius, and our plan was to let it ride for the next 5-10 years. We thought our investment was protected, but little did we know this was a Ponzi scheme all along – an investment fraud that pays new investors with funds collected from new investors. I believe Celsius qualifies, because as the markets crashed and people stopped putting money in, and rather started to panic and take their money out, the company went defunct. However, this still baffles me, because my ~$125,000 of investment that I thought Celsius was a safe haven for, became locked out. One would think if a BTC was worth 50K, and it went to 25K, you could technically access your BTC at the 25K if you needed to. This is not the case, and is heart breaking.

> Judge Glenn, I have sadly read letter after letter from disappointed to desperate account holders whose money has been frozen at best, and lost at worst by Celsius management. It breaks my heart to read these letters pleading for some kind of justice for the "little people". I consider myself one of these little people, not special or connected. I'm 71 years old, retired, and have money in the low six figures tied up in Celsius. Since I'm retired, I'll never have an opportunity to replace those funds. I don't know if I'll ever get any of my deposits back, but I am lucky in that regard. I won't starve and will still have a place to live. The money, foolishly, was for my heirs. I can't bring myself to let them know that I have lost their money, eventhough they didn't know it was housed in Celsius. In the end, I can only blame myself.

I've been oscillating between angry and depressed with this experience over the last two months with no access to my assets. I will not rest until depositors are made whole without a so called "haircut" on our funds deposited. Just like most people during this financial crisis created primarily by our government and financial governing bodies, I was trying to gain a little income to offset inflation caused by the Federal Reserve pushing rates to zero, buying up of all U.S debt/bonds, and the government flooding the market with a ridiculous excess of money supply and liquidity. Holding USD or cash in traditional banks with zero percent interest meant you were making no interest and losing significant buying power relative to the parabolic, historic inflation rate. Aside from the stable coin USDC, I only invested in the largest and safest crypto investments while primarily earning a modest rate of return with Celsius right now of 2.5% BTC and 4% ETH. Celsius and Alex Mashinsky fraudulently mislead depositors on their risk model or I would have never invested on this platform.

> I am a retired senior citizen of the USA. I saw no opportunity to earn interest on my life savings in a traditional bank and inflation is at record highs. I trusted Celsius to give me a reasonable rate of return on my life’s savings of about 5%, which I hold in stable coin, BTC and ETH. I own no CEL. I was mislead by Mr. M, who said that Celsius loans were over collateralized and that my money was safe. Now, I am facing financial ruin. Please do whatever is possible to save depositors’ money and please allow us to benefit from increases in crypto prices that will surely come at some point in the future. In the meantime, I pray for all of us who are suffering financially and emotionally because of Mr. M. The mental pressure is almost unbearable. The actions of Mr. M. have created unspeakable misery for many people and I am sure will result in suicides. I’m crying as I write this and feel sorry for us all. I would appreciate anything you can do to help make us whole.

> I write to you to let you know the devastating impact that Celsius is having on my life. My husband and I put in a combined amount of $138,000 USD into Celsius trusting their intent and care for customers. The thought of losing that amount of money is horrifying. That was our life savings. It was our chance of having a baby, and funding medical expenses. It was our chance of taking care of our parents as they age. Since the halt of withdrawals, I have not been able to sleep or eat properly. I have been emotionally distressed which is impacting my marriage and my life. I feel like I just cannot get up each day and keep going. My mother, who passed away of cancer when I was 19, left me with some money that I put into Celsius. If I do not get that back, I will end my life as the loss will impact my family and I significantly.

Needless to say a domestic helper’s salary barely covers living expenses for her family, yet alone savings. As a sign of gratitude, I created a Celsius account for her as a way to build and grow her retirement fund so she can go back to her home country and live her remaining year in relative comfort, as she deserves.

This made her a millionaire back home which allows her to live a decade (based on life expectancy) in great comfort, the ideal retirement. She was due to retire in August 2022 and I was only planning to pull assets out of her account in mid August.

> The filing of bankruptcy by Celsius Network LLC has added a lot of stress to me and my family. Depending on the outcome, we will need to delay our retirement plans and continue to be in the work force instead of enjoying our retirement. We will be forced to make up for the deposits we will potentially lose.

> I have over $25,000 worth of cryptocurrency deposited in a 'Custody' account with Celcius. I strongly feel that Celsius, in particular Alex Mashinsky has lied to the community about the safety of our assets. I feel like I have been lied to and mislead. I am embarrassed that I have so much money tied up in what now seems to be a scam and mismanagement of funds. It has affected me personally and now have so much anger with myself for getting my family in this position.

> Over the last year, I'd put most of my money into Celsius. I had done some research that led me to believe they were insured for any losses. As I watched companies (who had due diligence teams) put hundreds of millions into Celsius, I began putting most all of my digital currencies onto their platform. I never realized they would do the things they've done. I've put a lot of time, sweat, and money into mining digital currencies over the last year, and I really hope it's not just all gone, now.
> Weekly, I watched Celsius' "ask me anything" videos and would watch Alex himself say repeatedly they're not doing shady things with our money … but it seems they were. I feel betrayed by Celsius, and shame that I even went so far as to recommend Celsius to friends and family.

> [I am] a Finnish Citizen who has invested over 50 thousand USD for Celcisus Network's loan service. I have always been very conservative investor and invested to Celcius's service ONLY, because Alex Machinsky has continuously stated, every Friday, that they are secure.
> They have made claims such as:
  <ul>
    <li>Celsius is an alternative to conventional banks, they are safer than banks</li>
    <li>They have over 2 billion in their balance sheet</li>
    <li>They raised 750 million "to secure customer assets if something goes wrong"</li>
    <li>Continuously assured that the funds are safe</li>
  </ul>

> And so on. The whole company is a lie, we were lied to! We were deceived, I am embarrassed, sad and angry that my life savings were invested to a "bank" which was a lie. This will have significant ramifications to my retirement and it is beyond awful.

> Much of my life's savings are currently held hostage on the Celsius platform. Alex Mashinsky week after week promised the community that our funds were safe and not being used in any risky lending. Every week during his AMA's he promised that Celsius had the funds to cover all user assets and that under no circumstances were our funds at risk.

> When I joined Celsius i followed every AMA and live to listen to what the CEO Alex says and update, and from what I alway heard the investment where safe, and not speculation was used in our money, plus he said multiple time they had enough cash, more then any one else to cover any issue. Some of this live were done days before they freeze assets, so Alex was lying and he knew was a lye but he kept saying that. My brother tried to suicide and I had mental disorder and I cannot sleep now, I havent slpet since the account was frozen.

> About 6 months ago I deposited 20k in BTC and ETH to Celsius (my hard earned life savings). I followed the company for more than a year before I decided to let them hold my portfolio. I spend 100+ hours listening to Mr. Mashinsky and the communication of the company. Every Friday they uploaded video's on YouTube discussing the policy and the low risk you take as a costumer. Quotes that where said every week for over a year: "The worst thing that can happen is that everyone gets their coins back", "We have 2billion dollars on our balance sheet so there is zero risk in depositing your crypto on Celsius.", "Celsius is transparent and shares all of it's financial data.", "Celsius is safer than holding your money in the bank.", "Celsius will take full responsibility and will make sure depositors are always prioritized.", "Celsius is more regulatory compliant than all of it's competitors."

> I'm a Celsius depositor. My account balance is in the mid six figure range. The balance was in the seven figure range last year when cryptocurrency prices were at their peak.
>
> I consider myself to be "above average" in terms of understanding financial markets, as I hold an economics degree, but I am by no means an expert. The primary reason I was comfortable with Celsius was because Alex Mashinsky repeatedly stated on numerous youtube "AMAs (ask mashinsky anything)" and interviews that the yield paid on our cryptocurrency deposits was generated with overcollateralized lending. While I am no financial guru, to me, overcollateralization meant that if a debtor could not meet their obligations that Celsius would liquidate the posted collateral and ensure that the lent crypto holdings were retained.

> While I am fortunate to continue to be able to support my family despite this mishap, I worry about the financially vulnerable individuals who put their life savings into Celsius because they were encouraged to do so by Alex Mashinsky, despite the fact that he knew that the company was struggling from a financial standpoint. Single mothers, retirees, and other vulnerable individuals absolutely need their savings back.

> I am very affected by Celsius Network freezing my account and filing bankruptcy due to lack of risk management and false promises. Even though my assets were not in six figures, that was the majority of my life savings and retirement fund. As per their marketing and promotion, they promise withdrawal of our assets anytime. But When I tried withdrawing my cryptocurrency on June 13th, they did not let me withdraw.

> I am one of the many customers affected by these proceedings with a large portion of my savings...
>
> [B]eginning on 13 June 2022, I was stonewalled into having a loan with Celsius liquidated. This was primarily due to Celsius freezing transfers which took away all ability for users to manage their loans on their own. This forced users to rely on their support team, which was not able to react in time. Celsius froze transfers on 12 June 2022 and directed customers to contact support in order to resolve a margin call, advertising a 24-48 hour response time. On 13 June 2022, I received notification of a margin call and e-mailed support attempted to call their customer support line only to sit on hold for 4 hours only to be hung up on. My loan was liquidated on 18 June 2022. The first time I heard back from Celsius regarding this matter was 21 June, 8 days after initial contact, saying nothing can be done about it now. I requested a refund of the liquidation fee to show a sign of good faith to the customers only to be ignored again.

> I am an unaccredited investor who trusted Celsius with over $530,000 of Crypto Currency as of today Wednesday July 20th. As of April 2nd, 2022, this bucket of Crypto was valued over $1,000,000. I moved the bulk of these funds into Celsius in February of 2022 because I would Watch Alex Mashinsky on his weekly AMAs published on YouTube. He reiterated time and time again on Twitter and on these AMAs that the company was over collateralized and that should anything go wrong they have more than enough money to make all depositors whole. He also started that he himself would personally compensate investors to make them whole if ever needed.

> As a disabled Combat Veteran who served in the Afghanistan Campaign, it hasn't been easy for me to maintain employment and save money to build a future retirement for my family.

My 36k loan to Celsius that took me nearly a decade to save for with dedication and hard work for feels completely insignificant.

> I share a similar story as other depositors and investors of Celsius. I started depositing various crypto assets with Celsius Earn a little over a year ago (March 2021). I trusted Celsius with my funds and continued to do so despite market volatility and rumors about Celsius solvency on Twitter. CEO Alex Mashinsky reassured everyone on various media platform that Celsius is financially strong and had enough collateral to weather the downturn in the market. I left my all of my ETH (about 60 ETH <span class="inserted-note">[~$92,500 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_price">date of filing</a>]</span>) on Celsius in hopes for a modest return (not enough to beat current inflation) and now, like others, my ETH is locked and I have no way to access it.

I am writing to ask you to not grant Celsius to move forward with their current plan with Mashinsky, or any current executive leadership. I was clearly and unequivocally misled to believe that my funds were not used in risky leverage trading, and that they were completely secure unrelated to market conditions. It is obvious that there has been reckless misuse, and Celsius is not taking responsibility for their actions and cannot be trusted.

> As of July 13, Celsius Network claims they are no longer liquidating retail loans or demanding margin calls, but accepting loan repayments and continuing to hold coins posted as collateral. As a retail user with two current loans due on August 14 and August 28, I want to honor my obligation of paying back the principal and interest on my loans so that I may receive my ~4x collateral back. However, it makes no financial sense to send money to a bankrupt company when it is unknown what will happen to my collateral. Sir, I am requesting special consideration for all future loans that are due and especially the ones that are ~4x collateralized.

> I only have about $3500 (at today's value as of July 19th). But for me it is a very large amount. It is approximately ½ of my investment portfolio. The only reason I put it there was because I thought Celsius was safe. I was only earning 3-5% on my BTC/ETH, and since ETH when it is staked to ETH2.0 earns about 6-7%, I figured it was fine. The way they (in their weekly AMA's) explained it, was that the funds were either staked on the net with "safe" options such as ETH2.0 and MATIC. Or that it was lent out with <b><i>over collateralized</i></b> loans to individuals/institutions. Instead they took massive risks with them.
