_Trigger warning: Discussions of suicide._

People with funds locked in Celsius Network have been sending letters to the judge presiding over the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. These are excerpts from those letters.

It's important to understand that schemes like this in the cryptocurrency industry are hurting real people who are often suffering losses they can't afford. Regardless of what you may believe about individuals' decisions to put significant amounts of money into Celsius, blame lies with the executives creating and running these companies and with the U.S. legal and regulatory system for allowing companies like this to operate.

The goal of highlighting these excerpts is to illustrate this, and shed some light on how people are convinced to put their money into projects like Celsius. Celsius may have been one of the first companies to collapse in the 2022 crypto crash, but it is hardly unique.

All case filings can be viewed on [Stretto](https://cases.stretto.com/Celsius/court-docket/). Individual letters are linked alongside their excerpts. I have published similar excerpts [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1550160830762782724), and will be continuing to update that thread and this post as new letters are entered. New letters will go at the top of this post, which is in reverse order based on docket number.

If anyone is looking to submit a letter of their own, [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CelsiusNetwork/comments/w2x7f2/how_to_submit_a_letter_to_the_judge_and_contact/) seems to explain how.

## Background
On June 12, 2022, the cryptocurrency lending firm Celsius Network suspended customer withdrawals, swaps, and transfers. On July 13, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Users have been unable to withdraw crypto stored in Celsius accounts. Users with loans open are still having to add collateral to maintain their loans, despite not knowing if they'll be able to retrieve their collateral. Some have been forcibly liquidated even though they intended to add collateral to open loans, due to needing to go through the overloaded Celsius support team.

Celsius offered both "Earn" and "Custody" accounts. With Earn accounts, users received a percentage rate of return either in the $CEL token or in the same tokens they were holding. In April 2022, Celsius stopped allowing non-accredited investors in the United States to keep Earn accounts, in order to comply with U.S. regulations. With Custody accounts, coins are stored and could be transferred, swapped, or used for loan collateral, but did not accumulate the rewards of the Earn accounts.

> In 2021, I paid taxes on all my 1046 $USD earnings in the form of 1099-MISC. Not only am I not able to access any of these investments I once considered safe, but I was taxed on earnings that I may never see, in addition to potentially never seeing my savings again.

> I am one of the depositors in Celsius I have my life-saving funds currently locked in the platform. I am still feeling confused, having mental trauma and the current Celsius debacle has gotten myself into a financial constraint that somewhat changed and restricted my usual day to day life. With that, I am seeking help urgently from you, as I am feeling helpless at the moment.

> As I sit here behind my computer, I am almost at a loss for words due to the gross misrepresentation by Celsius Network LLC. In the past 6 weeks, the unexpected freeze of my accounts and subsequent filing of bankruptcy has disrupted both my and my family’s life. The stress of this event on both myself, and my family is beyond words. I don’t know how to express the guilt, the frustration, the shame, the self-doubt, and absolute anger that I am feeling regarding the burden I have caused and placed on my family

> This is the 1st day in a week that I’ve been able to be in my home and sit in front of my computer to type out this letter. Because of the anxiety I am feeling over this event, I have become depressed, moody and have even been drinking in an attempt to decrease my stress. Last week my wife of 17 years asked me to leave our home due to my emotional turmoil and unpredictability. I have missed work this past week as I have sought out help for behavioral counseling and marital counseling as my wife essentially left me last week over a depressive episode due to this. How do I explain to my daughters that the financial nest egg that would have been their start to a better future is now “frozen”, and we may never see those assets again. How do I possibly rebuild that nest egg now? Most importantly, how do I begin the healing process with my wife and my daughters over this?

> I made the decision to move my entire cryptocurrency portfolio, which at the time of writing this is over 80% of my life savings, to the Celsius platform on June 11th - just 24 hours before it was revealed that withdrawals were paused and all accounts were frozen. The total monetary investment is in excess of $80,000. It is mostly invested in Bitcoin, some Ethereum and over $6000 in USDC stablecoin.

> My funds are in a "custody account", which from what I understand should remain in my control, but unfortunately this is not the case. I never earned a single cent from Celsius, never used their earn program and it's a bitter pill to swallow that the freeze was announced as soon as I trustfully moved my assets there.

> Over the 10 years I have lived in the United States, I have worked very hard for my money at the United States Postal Service as a mail carrier. I have saved my money diligently with the hope of one day buying a house, and my recent investments were part of a plan to help achieve that. I don't wish to be rich, just to build a comfortable future for my loved ones and I.

> I deposited money on the Celsius platform as a retail investor who sought an opportunity for a safe, conservative investment. I am an “average Joe” of average means, I work full time as a registered nurse and I am raising a newborn daughter. I am not a rich man, I work hard, I serve my community and I abide by the law.

> Over the course of about one year, I purchased about $10,0000 worth of bitcoin and deposited it into Celsius for long term storage as these funds are dedicated to a down payment for a house and meeting the needs of my daughter.

> As a Celsius account holder with an initial principal balance of approximately $125,000 (of which I have withdrawn/transferred out $0 since my initial transfer into Celsius), a substantial portion of my life’s savings... It had taken me many years to be convinced enough to move a sizeable portion of my family’s savings from mutual funds into crypto. I purchased cryptocurrencies because I was made aware of Celsius Network, where I would have the opportunity to bank my cryptocurrencies somewhere that I could earn weekly interest, credited to my account in-kind, while holding for the long term... It was November 29, 2021 when I first started buying BTC, ETH, LINK, MATIC, and SNX and transferring it all into my Celsius account. I quickly got to a point where my family and I were satisfied by the amount of money we had parked in Celsius, and our plan was to let it ride for the next 5-10 years. We thought our investment was protected, but little did we know this was a Ponzi scheme all along – an investment fraud that pays new investors with funds collected from new investors. I believe Celsius qualifies, because as the markets crashed and people stopped putting money in, and rather started to panic and take their money out, the company went defunct. However, this still baffles me, because my ~$125,000 of investment that I thought Celsius was a safe haven for, became locked out. One would think if a BTC was worth 50K, and it went to 25K, you could technically access your BTC at the 25K if you needed to. This is not the case, and is heart breaking.

> Today, August 1, I have no access to my Crypto funds (20.156131 ETH <span class="inserted-note">[~$34,000 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_price">date of filing</a>]</span>, that were worth 71.888,66 USD at the time I deposited them on October 7, 2021). This situation seems unfair to me, because that is my money, my life savings. I trusted them. I´m from Argentina, a third world country where the US Dollar worth a lot of money to us (a Dollar is worth almost 300 Pesos). I decided to protect myself from the inflation of my country by having my savings in crypto and I trusted Celsius by depositing my money with them to obtain a small profit that would allow me to live at the exchange rate of the US dollar. Now I have nothing. I quit my job, to live off the rewards from Celsius, just like Alex Mashinsky encouraged us to do at the AMA's on YouTube... Now, I can’t access my money due to this mishandling by Celsius, I am full of debts and can’t pay my rent. I’m desperate and I feel like I'm living a nightmare. I really hope all this ends soon and be able to have access to my money to continue living.

> I do have to admit, the higher-than-normal interest payout for stablecoins is what attracted me to Celsius. Currently, I have deposited $19,596.14 USDC statblecoins, over the past 12 months. This money (USDC) was to be withdrawn yearly to pay my house property taxes, house insurance, and family living expenses. My point is, I did not invest in something risky, since I knew I needed this money monthly/yearly.

> I started working on my first job with my father when I was 14 years old, and I have not stopped working ever since. I am also used to keeping money in my monthly savings account. When I was a teenager, I learnt more about investments and got into the investing world. I became an investor in the stock market and I multiplied my assets in a conscious and planned way. In 2020, I decided to start researching the cryptocurrency market, and I have embarked on this journey since then.

> I invested all my capital accumulated in these years due to honest work as a simple salesman with an income of roughly $234.30/month. I converted all my assets into cryptocurrencies (stocks, my apartment and a car). Therefore, I decided, in 2021, after searching about Celsius, to use half of it to apply for the loan program and the other half to keep aside to pay off the loans at some point in the future, always acting in good faith when in business with an entity or a person. I have always paid off my debts.

> Today, I come to Your Excellency asking you to consider my situation. I know the amount in my account may not seem like much to many in the US, but it means a lot to people from developing countries, like me, and losing that amount would have an immeasurable impact on my current life and my future. Seeing the money I saved as a 14-year-old boy lost like this out of the blue is heartbreaking.

> I have been trying my best to write to you for the past two weeks, but I am just so depressed that it has been a real chore. The fact that past 11 years of saving my money, then rolling it into Bitcoin 2020 that was stored in what I thought was a relatively ‘safe’ bet has now been greatly compromised. I have sweated, bled, cried, and worked 50+ hours weeks for 10 + years, not to mention out of those 7 and half years I went to school full time and worked full time and was going to use this as my nest egg to pay my student loans which payment begins assuming in January 2023. To be here now only feels that I have been deceived, taken advantage of, and held hostage for what I thought this entire time was MINE. ... This is supposed to be some of the happiest moments of my life where I just graduated college with an awesome engineering degree, moved to a new exotic big city, earned a dream career in a top fortune 100 company and someone is just trying to walk away legally with my assets that I worked so hard and their defense is its in the terms of agreement and its social medias fault?????? NO! I don’t walk 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, I want all Back because it is MINE!!!! If anything, I should be suing for emotional damages!! I won’t and don’t believe in that sort of thing though. I just want what is MINE! I can wait because I never planned on selling it. It is intended for generations of [writer's surname]’s down the line, and this is not just money. Its Bitcoin!!! Anyways I digress other people have been doing a great job of expressing of how I am feeling because the shame, the anger, deep sadness, the humiliation, irresponsibility (I convinced a friend to put roughly a 3rd of a bitcoin in to Celsius too) anxiety I feel is immense, and while I am managing my mental health with resources from my new job, it is still extreme distracting, and I know the courts will determine what is just and what isn’t.

> I'm a Celsius depositor at risk of losing much of my life savings that is locked on Celsius. I'm a 72-year-old woman who supports myself with parttime work and social security. It took me four years of buying BTC and ETH in small increments to accrue the 1 Bitcoin <span class="inserted-note">[~$23,000 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_price">date of filing</a>]</span>, 7 ETH <span class="inserted-note">[~$11,500 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_price">date of filing</a>]</span> that are now locked in Celsius. I planned to hold these assets in a safe crypto 'bank' and wait for them to increase in value so I could pay off my mortgage. Only without a mortgage payment will I be able to exist on just social security. I'm now facing the loss of my savings and a future of mortgage payments I can't pay due to Celsius' fraud against depositors.

While this looks to be the case, I wish to point out that on a percentage of total wealth basis few would exceed our loss.

I also know that many people are speculators, not someone like myself who is searching for ways to supplement Social Security income, especially during a high inflationary environment.

> I'm reaching out to you as a Secured Creditor in Celsius who has been a VIP client of Celsius since September 2021.

> Before joining Celsius, I did tremendous research and talked with Celsius customer service, who promised me that my funds were safe because **I controlled the keys to my wallet**. I trusted the company and I decided to pour all of my life savings with the company, lending them $632,329.03. ...

> I must also say that the whole time I was a customer, I was solicited by Taylor Hendrickson, Celsius Corporate & VIP Account Manager, who begged me to become an **accredited investor**, since I owned significant amounts of bitcoins and other assets. He warned me saying that if I do not become an accredited investor, I would not be able to collect any more interest because New Jersey gave Celsius a cease & desist order to stop them from fraudulently enticing more customers with the promise of high interest bearing account, which Mashinsky claimed was safer than a bank. ...

> I have absolutely no money left in my bank account now, and if I do not get my money back, I will be out in the streets with nothing to show for it. I plead with you, please help the individual clients of Celsius first, ahead of corporate clients. We will lose the roof over our head if we do not get our money back.

> Judge Glenn, I have sadly read letter after letter from disappointed to desperate account holders whose money has been frozen at best, and lost at worst by Celsius management. It breaks my heart to read these letters pleading for some kind of justice for the "little people". I consider myself one of these little people, not special or connected. I'm 71 years old, retired, and have money in the low six figures tied up in Celsius. Since I'm retired, I'll never have an opportunity to replace those funds. I don't know if I'll ever get any of my deposits back, but I am lucky in that regard. I won't starve and will still have a place to live. The money, foolishly, was for my heirs. I can't bring myself to let them know that I have lost their money, eventhough they didn't know it was housed in Celsius. In the end, I can only blame myself.

> As background, I am a medical professional working to support Oncology research, so I am not an expert on cryptocurrency or bankruptcy legal expert. I am one of the creditors with well over six figures of my savings invested on this platform. I've been oscillating between angry and depressed with this experience over the last two months with no access to my assets. I will not rest until depositors are made whole without a so called "haircut" on our funds deposited. Just like most people during this financial crisis created primarily by our government and financial governing bodies, I was trying to gain a little income to offset inflation caused by the Federal Reserve pushing rates to zero, buying up of all U.S debt/bonds, and the government flooding the market with a ridiculous excess of money supply and liquidity. Holding USD or cash in traditional banks with zero percent interest meant you were making no interest and losing significant buying power relative to the parabolic, historic inflation rate. Aside from the stable coin USDC, I only invested in the largest and safest crypto investments while primarily earning a modest rate of return with Celsius right now of 2.5% BTC and 4% ETH. Celsius and Alex Mashinsky fraudulently mislead depositors on their risk model or I would have never invested on this platform.

The small fortune that Celcius has taken away from me was my life-savings that I have been building with sweat and sacrifice for 12 years and because of my situation this also includes sacrifices my mother has made. It is indeed small compared to other investors, but it carried with it my big hope for financial security.

> The fact that Celsius is regulated by the state of New York and SEC compliant was a significant reason I decided to trust Alex and move my money on to this platform. I must ask what is the point of regulations if these regulations at the end of the day don’t hold any water? Regulations are supposed to provide security. Hasn’t anything been learned since the 2008 financial crisis? SEC compliant is this not the case and loans can be made without collateral? Should we trust anything with these claims?

> My deposits into Celsius are one crypto currency and the other is a stable coin. I trusted that my money was safe on Celsius because of the fact that Celsius is regulated in the United States, so it must be safe, since they would never be able to make uncollateralized loans using my USDC coins as collateral, the regulatory body would never allow such a thing, especially after the 2008 financial crisis. This was my thought process, so it would have been better if they were not regulated in New York, because then I would have assumed that my money is not safe.

The plan was to work a ridiculous amount of hours and live in a very cheap run down property to maximise savings. The end game was to buy a house for myself and my child. I have no family over here and nobody to fall back on so I had to come up with a plan. I have lost everything. How can I explain this to my son? I feel ashamed at myself.

> I too, was led to believe that Celsius was the “safest, most transparent home for crypto”, and for that reason held almost the entirety of my assets with them - emphasis on past tense.

> Now, I am presently in a position whereby I can’t make rent and I am well behind with my tax savings as I had entrusted them to look after my funds. I am in major need of money and feeling somewhat helpless, especially as a small holder; powerless.

> I was a keen purchaser of and believer in Luna Classic – for a decentralised future - before its collapse and for the seasons stated above, also kept 100% of my Luna (equating to 85% of my cryptocurrency wealth) with Celsius. Following the de-pegging of UST and the collapse of Luna I was desperate and resentful, as well as having the overwhelming feeling of stupidity on my own part.

> However, all was not lost as I still had money – worth roughly $1300 today – on Celsius, which may be pennies to some but would drag me from the hole I find myself in. I am particularly interested in my 770 MATIC <span class="inserted-note">[~$700 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_price">date of filing</a>]</span>, which again wouldn’t be worth writing about for most, but to me represents a chance at a better future for myself and a chance to eventually begin to average into that asset once more with the hope of being in a better financial situation in years to come.

> As things stand, I have roughly 100 Euro in my bank account with a personal loan of 130 to repay monthly, and no means to even make the rest up. As mentioned before with my tax savings, I am in the first year of self-employment so things are very, very hard anyway. The jump, believe it or not, was due to the fact that I had managed to accumulate almost $15000 with Luna and therefore had a ‘safety blanket’ to see me through the opening stages of my new adventure, yet here I am.

> On May 27th, 2022, after viewing several recent videos of Alex Mashinsky promising that my crypto assets would be safe and that I would receive 6.50% APY on my BTC and 6.00% APY on my ETH, I transferred 0.868842 BTC <span class="inserted-note">[~$25,400 on <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history/">date of deposit</a>]</span> & 11.670072 ETH <span class="inserted-note">[~$21,000 on <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD/history/">date of deposit</a>]</span> onto the Celsius Network. I was also promised $550 in 30 to 90 days as a promotion to entice me to transfer my assets to Celsius. I found that after I transferred my crypto assets that the actual APY quoted was only on a small portion of my holdings. Still, the actual APY was about the same as I was receiving else ware, so I decided to stay with Celsius to receive the promotional rewards. Just 16 days later, and after receiving no APY or rewards, I was informed that I could no longer withdrawal my assets.

> I am a Brazilian worker and I put all my money on this platform, as ALEX (CEO) said that we would be safe from the risks of banks and would offer a loan with an interest rate compatible with the market. It makes no sense to disappear with the money where it has a collateral, that is, I deposited 200,000 USD in bitcoin to withdraw the loan of 50,000 USD. The goal was not to have to sell my bitcoins during this market rally. Therefore, the collateral was practically 4x, or in some cases 2x, the loan amount.

> I have approximately $7500-10k depending on BTC price locked up and cannot withdraw from my Celsius account. I am a teacher that took a $2500 usdc loan from Celsius last summer. I do not get paid in the summer and needed some funds to get through summer so I wanted to give Celsius a try as they advertise low interest loans by utilizing collateral. I transfered $7500 worth of bitcoin as collateral for this $2500 USDC loan.

> As the price of BTC started to come down this June, I kept getting emails about margin calls in about myCelsius account and how I needed to add more BTC to not get liquidated, so I deposited 2500 worth of USD to pay off the loan so I could get my collateral BTC back but the site would not allow me to transfer or make any payments, and as a result, most of my BTC collateral was liquidated and stolen by Celsius to this point. The site was frozen and I could not even withdraw my $2500 USD out that I had just deposited. I have 2 children ages 4 and 6 and these funds could have been used for their development and family obligations.

> I am one of the customers who has my funds stuck with Celsius. Celsius is a company registered in the USA. Now USA being the frontrunner in almost every aspect from big businesses to new technological innovations, everyone would expect that if Celsius got its registration license in the USA, they must be running a legitimate operation, as USA is known to be strict with legal compliances related to businesses. Moreover, CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky, prior to the halt of withdrawals, used to come live every week and assure the customers that Celsius is fully transparent and customers' funds are safe. I am from India and I have $14,000 stuck with Celsius. This amount is a huge amount for an Indian. An average Indian makes $5000 a year. With my $14,000 stuck with Celsius, I have been very stressed and suicidal since the halt of withdrawals. I am the sole breadwinner of my family and its my responsibility to take care of my family members and provide food on their plates. $14,000 might not be a huge amount for an American but for me, an Indian, it is years of savings.

> I started reviewing e-mails on my phone. I saw that there was an e-mail from a Crypto company that was holding about $40,000-$50,000 worth of my assets (depending on current market price). The subject of the e-mail stated that it was an important message. I opened the e-mail and began to read. By the time I finished the e-mail I had collapsed onto the floor with my head in my hands as I fought back tears.

> I did my best to go the office and face my peers on June 13th, 2022. It was impossible to focus on my tasks for the day. It was like a living nightmare. However, it was nowhere near as bad as when I returned home to face my family.

> My family is what would fairly be considered middle class. My wife is a teacher and I am a sales manager. It is my job to manage the family's finances. Throughout the past two years I took an interest in trading cryptocurrency. I made a respectable profit and decided that I wanted to start a nest egg with the 7 Ethereum (valued at approximately $25k at the time) that I had earned through my trading efforts. Through a recommendation of a friend I came across Celsius. I reviewed their web site and began doing research by watching their AMA's and reading reviews on the internet. I liked what I saw as Celsius seemed like a very transparent organization that would allow me to earn returns on my cryptocurrency as if it was in a bank.

> Every day since June 13th, 2022 I have gotten up and felt terrible for a portion of the day. I look at my children and think how the money that Celsius seized from me could be put towards improving their lives. It could have been in a college fund or it could have been put towards a vacation for them to enjoy. Instead, our hard earned money was gambled away like nothing by the operators of Celsius.

> I have been a customer of Celsius for nearly 2 years. During this time I took out two crypto backed loans. I used the money to finance a business venture. Last month one of my loans was closed and my collateral was liquidated. I would have added more collateral, but was advised not to do so given the fact that Celsius had paused transfers and withdrawals. The liquidation of my loan has costed me approximately $21,000.
> Presently I have approximately $65,000 in savings on the Celsius platform. I put my savings there because I felt I could trust the platform and company. This trust was generated by countless hours watching Alex Mashinsky give press interviews in which he sold Celsius as a safe and secure option for savings and lending. I work in technology and have an excellent understanding of blockchain and crypto currencies. I performed due diligence on Celsius, only to learn that I have been lied to.

Everything I had remaining for a purchase of a home for my two children and wife here in SouthWest Florida. I trusted Celsius so explicitly due to Alex Mashinsky constantly broadcasting what I thought were truths and axioms that the company and himself lived by. How clearly I was wrong. I took out a $1,000 and $5,000 loan and was unable to add necessary collateral to two margin calls that were enacted during their pause of transfers and withdrawals. The collateral was available and ready, only to watch nearly the entirety of my crypto evaporate away with no recourse to solve. I feel absolutely disgusted with what has since unfolded.

The primary reason I was comfortable with Celsius was because Alex Mashinsky repeatedly stated on numerous youtube "AMAs (ask mashinsky anything)" and interviews that the yield paid on our cryptocurrency deposits was generated with overcollateralized lending. While I am no financial guru, to me, overcollateralization meant that if a debtor could not meet their obligations that Celsius would liquidate the posted collateral and ensure that the lent crypto holdings were retained.

> While I am fortunate to continue to be able to support my family despite this mishap, I worry about the financially vulnerable individuals who put their life savings into Celsius because they were encouraged to do so by Alex Mashinsky, despite the fact that he knew that the company was struggling from a financial standpoint.

This was primarily due to Celsius freezing transfers which took away all ability for users to manage their loans on their own. This forced users to rely on their support team, which was not able to react in time. Celsius froze transfers on 12 June 2022 and directed customers to contact support in order to resolve a margin call, advertising a 24-48 hour response time. On 13 June 2022, I received notification of a margin call and e-mailed support attempted to call their customer support line only to sit on hold for 4 hours only to be hung up on. My loan was liquidated on 18 June 2022. The first time I heard back from Celsius regarding this matter was 21 June, 8 days after initial contact, saying nothing can be done about it now. I requested a refund of the liquidation fee to show a sign of good faith to the customers only to be ignored again.

I was clearly and unequivocally misled to believe that my funds were not used in risky leverage trading, and that they were completely secure unrelated to market conditions. It is obvious that there has been reckless misuse, and Celsius is not taking responsibility for their actions and cannot be trusted.

> I am writing to you today, as a Celsius user (since January 2021), that currently has my life savings in crypto locked and inaccessible. Alex Mashinsky and the Celsius Management Team expressed multiple times, on Tuesday Twitter Spaces and Friday YouTube AMA's (Ask Mashinsky Anything), the following phrases: "UnBank Yourself", "HODL with Celsius", "Banks Are Not Your Friends" and "Do Good, then Do Well".

> Retail investors have even expressed "suicidal statements" on Twitter as a result of this unforeseen incident. I even referred friends and family to Celsius and their life savings are now in jeopardy.

> As of July 13, Celsius Network claims they are no longer liquidating retail loans or demanding margin calls, but accepting loan repayments and continuing to hold coins posted as collateral. As a retail user with two current loans due on August 14 and August 28, I want to honor my obligation of paying back the principal and interest on my loans so that I may receive my ~4x collateral back. However, it makes no financial sense to send money to a bankrupt company when it is unknown what will happen to my collateral. Sir, I am requesting special consideration for all future loans that are due and especially the ones that are ~4x collateralized.

> My life savings were in Celsius. I trusted Alex. I pray and hope everyday you are doing everything in your power to rightfully return deposits back to customers. I can't tell my wife and kids our retirement and dreams have been stolen from us. Life is stale, we need updates and silence is not the answer. Please I request you to help put the interest of unsecured creditors, or as Alex famously called his "community" first.

> I am a Celsius customer with a little over $15k worth of deposits that are locked up in Celsius. $15k may not mean a lot to some people, but it is about 65% or my life savings.

> Losing all of my savings will have irreparable consequences on the well-being of myself and my family. I am ashamed, humiliated, and quite frankly, disgusted, that I put all my trust into a company that has clearly participated in near fraudulent activity. I will be spending years trying to make back the money I lost.

> I only have about $3500 (at today's value as of July 19th). But for me it is a very large amount. It is approximately ½ of my investment portfolio. The only reason I put it there was because I thought Celsius was safe. I was only earning 3-5% on my BTC/ETH, and since ETH when it is staked to ETH2.0 earns about 6-7%, I figured it was fine. The way they (in their weekly AMA's) explained it, was that the funds were either staked on the net with "safe" options such as ETH2.0 and MATIC. Or that it was lent out with <b><i>over collateralized</i></b> loans to individuals/institutions. Instead they took massive risks with them.

> I share a similar story to many other depositors who have modest amounts of their net worth locked in Celsius. From spending time on various social media forums and groups I have seen the range of devastation this lockup has caused.

> I like many others were led astray by Mr. Mashinsky and his lies. We trusted the company was ran in a safe and productive manner because their leader always expressed that. I do not believe these terms of services should be deemed valid. There is zero chance I or others would have become a customer of Celsius if their terrible business practices were disclosed.

> Like many investors, I have lost a large chunk of my life savings and struggle to live daily with devastation and extreme stress of watching on the sideline feeling powerless over my money, which I entrusted with Celsius to manage. Alex Mashinsky and Celsius Management have been engaging in deceptive marketing of their platform and products using catchy phrases such as "Unbank yourself" and "Banks are not your friends" to imply that leaving funds with Celsius is just like depositing funds on savings accounts with traditional banks, if not superior.

> Celsius customer base extends beyond the United States and its impacts are far‐reaching and impacting the lives of Non‐US resident depositors like myself.

> This has ruined people beyond comprehension: please peruse r/CelsiusNetwork should you have a human interest in what is happening with people who are not as sophisticated as yourself even. The marketing lies, the deceit, and the lack of accountability will be paid in blood by many.

> This person preyed on fears of losing money during the next economic downturn and lied about how our money/assets were managed.
