People with funds locked in Celsius Network have been sending letters to the judge presiding over the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. These are excerpts from those letters.

It's important to understand that schemes like this in the cryptocurrency industry are hurting real people who are often suffering losses they can't afford. Regardless of what you may believe about individuals' decisions to put significant amounts of money into Celsius, blame lies with the executives creating and running these companies and with the U.S. legal and regulatory system for allowing companies like this to operate.

The goal of highlighting these excerpts is to illustrate this, and shed some light on how people are convinced to put their money into projects like Celsius. Celsius may have been one of the first companies to collapse in the 2022 crypto crash, but it is hardly unique.

All case filings can be viewed on [Stretto](https://cases.stretto.com/Celsius/court-docket/). Individual letters are linked alongside their excerpts. I have published similar excerpts [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1550160830762782724), and will be continuing to update that thread and this post as new letters are entered. New letters will go at the top of this post, which is in reverse order based on docket number.

## Background
On June 12, 2022, the cryptocurrency lending firm Celsius Network suspended customer withdrawals, swaps, and transfers. On July 13, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Users have been unable to withdraw crypto stored in Celsius accounts. Users with loans open are still having to add collateral to maintain their loans, despite not knowing if they'll be able to retrieve their collateral. Some have been forcibly liquidated even though they intended to add collateral to open loans, due to needing to go through the overloaded Celsius support team.

Celsius offered both "Earn" and "Custody" accounts. With Earn accounts, users received a percentage rate of return either in the $CEL token or in the same tokens they were holding. In April 2022, Celsius stopped allowing non-accredited investors in the United States to keep Earn accounts, in order to comply with U.S. regulations. With Custody accounts, coins are stored and can be transferred, swapped, or used for loan collateral, but do not accumulate the rewards of the Earn accounts.

> I placed my entire EIDL <span class="inserted-note">[<a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/covid-19-economic-injury-disaster-loan/about-covid-19-eidl">Economic Injury Disaster Loan</a>]</span> loan, $525,000 in Celsius to earn an APY to help pay back the 3.9% interest on the loan while I was in the process of deciding on if I would keep the EIDL or use it on my business.

> The funds in my Celsius Custodial account are not mine, they are the US Governments and I my entire business is secured and backed by these funds. If they are not returned, my business would go bankrupt, my 15 employees would be let go, and 14 years of my life’s work lost and at the age of 49 years old, I would have to start over with nothing. The thought of losing this money has left me depressed, suicidal, and without words. Please return our money.

> I have been a loyal Celsius customer since 2019 and feel completely lied to by Alex Mashinsky. I watched every single AMA (Ask Me Anything) each friday since sign-up and week in and week out Alex would talk about how Celsius is safer than banks because they supposedly don't rehypothecate and use fractional reserve lending like the banks do. "The banks are not your friends," he would constantly say.

> The money I deposited is meant as my life savings and I know I'm one of many in this situation.

> I come from India to make American dream a reality and in the process, I worked hard and there are weeks that I worked for 84 hrs. a week just to make some savings, buy a home and build a life here. But all I get is disappointment and got cheated I invested all my savings for last 3 years and was able to get one full Bitcoin. Alex kept saying our investments are safe with Celsius, though there was lot of FUD on Twitter I believed Alex. I am just a normal guy trying to make a living here and keep my family safe and happy.

> I have held to the belief that Celsius would not engage in such risky behaviors as what has been revealed lately, and am shocked and appalled that my life is now back to square one as far as earning potential and safety for my family and young children. My life savings is gone thanks to these people.

> I sent Celsius a good part of my retirement and also my wife's last year. Alex Mashinsky has said over and over how this was a safe alternative to banking, and led me to believe interest was generated with fully collateralized loans.

[Doc 115](https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174907222280000000033.pdf), filed July 21, 2022:

> I have approximately $7500-10k depending on BTC price locked up and cannot withdraw from my Celsius account. I am a teacher that took a $2500 usdc loan from Celsius last summer. I do not get paid in the summer and needed some funds to get through summer so I wanted to give Celsius a try as they advertise low interest loans by utilizing collateral. I transfered $7500 worth of bitcoin as collateral for this $2500 USDC loan.

> As the price of BTC started to come down this June, I kept getting emails about margin calls in about myCelsius account and how I needed to add more BTC to not get liquidated, so I deposited 2500 worth of USD to pay off the loan so I could get my collateral BTC back but the site would not allow me to transfer or make any payments, and as a result, most of my BTC collateral was liquidated and stolen by Celsius to this point. The site was frozen and I could not even withdraw my $2500 USD out that I had just deposited. I have 2 children ages 4 and 6 and these funds could have been used for their development and family obligations.

> I am just a 50 year old, healthcare worker. I don't have much compared to others, but it is a lot to me and my family. All my crypto is sitting in the CUSTODY account program. Today, the value of my holdings is $19053.45 but of course, it was worth double when I purchased and I am sure it will triple in the near future. I just want my crypto back.

> I am frustrated, cant sleep, my husband does not know this happened. Please do us justice. Celsius lied to us, watch the AMA videos and you will see why we all believed.

> I am a Celsius customer with over 100k worth of deposits that are locked up in Celsius. This amount is about 90% of my life savings. Losing all of my savings will have irreparable consequences on the well-being of myself and my family. I feel ashamed to put all my trust into a company that has clearly participated in near fraudulent activity. I can't imagine how many more years I will need to make back the money I lost.

[Doc 112](https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174907222280000000027.pdf), filed July 21, 2022:

> I am one of the customers who has my funds stuck with Celsius. Celsius is a company registered in the USA. Now USA being the frontrunner in almost every aspect from big businesses to new technological innovations, everyone would expect that if Celsius got its registration license in the USA, they must be running a legitimate operation, as USA is known to be strict with legal compliances related to businesses. Moreover, CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky, prior to the halt of withdrawals, used to come live every week and assure the customers that Celsius is fully transparent and customers' funds are safe. I am from India and I have $14,000 stuck with Celsius. This amount is a huge amount for an Indian. An average Indian makes $5000 a year. With my $14,000 stuck with Celsius, I have been very stressed and suicidal since the halt of withdrawals. I am the sole breadwinner of my family and its my responsibility to take care of my family members and provide food on their plates. $14,000 might not be a huge amount for an American but for me, an Indian, it is years of savings.

> I started reviewing e-mails on my phone. I saw that there was an e-mail from a Crypto company that was holding about $40,000-$50,000 worth of my assets (depending on current market price). The subject of the e-mail stated that it was an important message. I opened the e-mail and began to read. By the time I finished the e-mail I had collapsed onto the floor with my head in my hands as I fought back tears.

> I did my best to go the office and face my peers on June 13th, 2022. It was impossible to focus on my tasks for the day. It was like a living nightmare. However, it was nowhere near as bad as when I returned home to face my family.

> My family is what would fairly be considered middle class. My wife is a teacher and I am a sales manager. It is my job to manage the family's finances. Throughout the past two years I took an interest in trading cryptocurrency. I made a respectable profit and decided that I wanted to start a nest egg with the 7 Ethereum (valued at approximately $25k at the time) that I had earned through my trading efforts. Through a recommendation of a friend I came across Celsius. I reviewed their web site and began doing research by watching their AMA's and reading reviews on the internet. I liked what I saw as Celsius seemed like a very transparent organization that would allow me to earn returns on my cryptocurrency as if it was in a bank.

> Every day since June 13th, 2022 I have gotten up and felt terrible for a portion of the day. I look at my children and think how the money that Celsius seized from me could be put towards improving their lives. It could have been in a college fund or it could have been put towards a vacation for them to enjoy. Instead, our hard earned money was gambled away like nothing by the operators of Celsius.

> I have been a customer of Celsius for nearly 2 years. During this time I took out two crypto backed loans. I used the money to finance a business venture. Last month one of my loans was closed and my collateral was liquidated. I would have added more collateral, but was advised not to do so given the fact that Celsius had paused transfers and withdrawals. The liquidation of my loan has costed me approximately $21,000.
> Presently I have approximately $65,000 in savings on the Celsius platform. I put my savings there because I felt I could trust the platform and company. This trust was generated by countless hours watching Alex Mashinsky give press interviews in which he sold Celsius as a safe and secure option for savings and lending. I work in technology and have an excellent understanding of blockchain and crypto currencies. I performed due diligence on Celsius, only to learn that I have been lied to.

> I'm writing in regards to Celsius Network and their practices that have left my family and I in dark times. I joined Celsius Network earlier in the year and had deposited $15,000. Everything I had remaining for a purchase of a home for my two children and wife here in SouthWest Florida. I trusted Celsius so explicitly due to Alex Mashinsky constantly broadcasting what I thought were truths and axioms that the company and himself lived by. How clearly I was wrong. I took out a $1,000 and $5,000 loan and was unable to add necessary collateral to two margin calls that were enacted during their pause of transfers and withdrawals. The collateral was available and ready, only to watch nearly the entirety of my crypto evaporate away with no recourse to solve. I feel absolutely disgusted with what has since unfolded.

> I had hundreds of thousands of dollars in USDC and Bitcoin deposited in Celsius. As part of the decision to store my assets on Celsius over the past 14 months, I listened to, and believed, Mr. Alex Mashinsky speak to the trustworthiness of Celsius on live streams, in print, and as part of the Celsius AMA ("ask me anything") conferences he held on Fridays.

> I am one of many Celsius users with crypto on the platform. I deposited stable coins, believing that the yield was being generated from over collateralized loans, which Mashinsky is on record stating many times. I watched the AMAs weekly, youtube videos and twitter communications from Mashansky; he misled all of us, stating he had 2 billion in reserves, no exposure to risky practices including overleveraging. Had I known the loans were under collateralized, the balance sheet deficit, the staking, trading, etc. I would not withdrawn my coins. I avoided Terra/Luna, instead choosing stable coins backed by dollars.

> I am a female client from Australia with crypto deposits on the Celsius Network. Similar to many other retail investors, I and my family are severely impacted both in financial terms and mental health by the bankruptcy and locked up funds.
> I am expecting my third child in 2.5 months and need the money to pay for the doctor, hospital and expenses. Also, my aunt is seriously ill and needs my financial support for her major operation (please refer to screenshots provided below). However, all of my savings have been tied up in the Celsius network. I was planning to withdraw from Celsius to fund my birth and my aunt's operation in late June, but due to the withdrawal halt, I don't have access to any funds and my life has become so miserable now. I am worried that my stress due to Celsius's situation will affect the health of my unborn child. Also, my two other children are still in primary ages and my family also need to fund locked in Celsius for their education.

I never realized they would do the things they've done. I've put a lot of time, sweat, and money into mining digital currencies over the last year, and I really hope it's not just all gone, now.

I spend 100+ hours listening to Mr. Mashinsky and the communication of the company. Every Friday they uploaded video's on YouTube discussing the policy and the low risk you take as a costumer. Quotes that where said every week for over a year: "The worst thing that can happen is that everyone gets their coins back", "We have 2billion dollars on our balance sheet so there is zero risk in depositing your crypto on Celsius.", "Celsius is transparent and shares all of it's financial data.", "Celsius is safer than holding your money in the bank.", "Celsius will take full responsibility and will make sure depositors are always prioritized.", "Celsius is more regulatory compliant than all of it's competitors."

> I'm a Celsius depositor. My account balance is in the mid six figure range. The balance was in the seven figure range last year when cryptocurrency prices were at their peak.

> I consider myself to be "above average" in terms of understanding financial markets, as I hold an economics degree, but I am by no means an expert. The primary reason I was comfortable with Celsius was because Alex Mashinsky repeatedly stated on numerous youtube "AMAs (ask mashinsky anything)" and interviews that the yield paid on our cryptocurrency deposits was generated with overcollateralized lending. While I am no financial guru, to me, overcollateralization meant that if a debtor could not meet their obligations that Celsius would liquidate the posted collateral and ensure that the lent crypto holdings were retained.

> While I am fortunate to continue to be able to support my family despite this mishap, I worry about the financially vulnerable individuals who put their life savings into Celsius because they were encouraged to do so by Alex Mashinsky, despite the fact that he knew that the company was struggling from a financial standpoint. Single mothers, retirees, and other vulnerable individuals absolutely need their savings back.

> [B]eginning on 13 June 2022, I was stonewalled into having a loan with Celsius liquidated. This was primarily due to Celsius freezing transfers which took away all ability for users to manage their loans on their own. This forced users to rely on their support team, which was not able to react in time. Celsius froze transfers on 12 June 2022 and directed customers to contact support in order to resolve a margin call, advertising a 24-48 hour response time. On 13 June 2022, I received notification of a margin call and e-mailed support attempted to call their customer support line only to sit on hold for 4 hours only to be hung up on. My loan was liquidated on 18 June 2022. The first time I heard back from Celsius regarding this matter was 21 June, 8 days after initial contact, saying nothing can be done about it now. I requested a refund of the liquidation fee to show a sign of good faith to the customers only to be ignored again.

I moved the bulk of these funds into Celsius in February of 2022 because I would Watch Alex Mashinsky on his weekly AMAs published on YouTube.

He also started that he himself would personally compensate investors to make them whole if ever needed.

> I am a Celsius amount holder, with .85 Bitcoin <span class="inserted-note">[~$19,900 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_price">date of filing</a>]</span>, 1 ETH <span class="inserted-note">[~$1,500 on <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_price">date of filing</a>]</span>, and a various amount of other crypto currencies. I am writing to ask you to not grant Celsius to move forward with their current plan with Mashinsky, or any current executive leadership. I was clearly and unequivocally misled to believe that my funds were not used in risky leverage trading, and that they were completely secure unrelated to market conditions. It is obvious that there has been reckless misuse, and Celsius is not taking responsibility for their actions and cannot be trusted.

> I am writing to you today, as a Celsius user (since January 2021), that currently has my life savings in crypto locked and inaccessible. Alex Mashinsky and the Celsius Management Team expressed multiple times, on Tuesday Twitter Spaces and Friday YouTube AMA's (Ask Mashinsky Anything), the following phrases: "UnBank Yourself", "HODL with Celsius", "Banks Are Not Your Friends" and "Do Good, then Do Well".

> Retail investors have even expressed "suicidal statements" on Twitter as a result of this unforeseen incident. I even referred friends and family to Celsius and their life savings are now in jeopardy.

> As of July 13, Celsius Network claims they are no longer liquidating retail loans or demanding margin calls, but accepting loan repayments and continuing to hold coins posted as collateral. As a retail user with two current loans due on August 14 and August 28, I want to honor my obligation of paying back the principal and interest on my loans so that I may receive my ~4x collateral back. However, it makes no financial sense to send money to a bankrupt company when it is unknown what will happen to my collateral. Sir, I am requesting special consideration for all future loans that are due and especially the ones that are ~4x collateralized.

> My life savings were in Celsius. I trusted Alex. I pray and hope everyday you are doing everything in your power to rightfully return deposits back to customers. I can't tell my wife and kids our retirement and dreams have been stolen from us. Life is stale, we need updates and silence is not the answer. Please I request you to help put the interest of unsecured creditors, or as Alex famously called his "community" first.

> I am a Celsius customer with a little over $15k worth of deposits that are locked up in Celsius. $15k may not mean a lot to some people, but it is about 65% or my life savings.

> Losing all of my savings will have irreparable consequences on the well-being of myself and my family. I am ashamed, humiliated, and quite frankly, disgusted, that I put all my trust into a company that has clearly participated in near fraudulent activity. I will be spending years trying to make back the money I lost.

> I only have about $3500 (at today's value as of July 19th). But for me it is a very large amount. It is approximately ½ of my investment portfolio. The only reason I put it there was because I thought Celsius was safe. I was only earning 3-5% on my BTC/ETH, and since ETH when it is staked to ETH2.0 earns about 6-7%, I figured it was fine. The way they (in their weekly AMA's) explained it, was that the funds were either staked on the net with "safe" options such as ETH2.0 and MATIC. Or that it was lent out with <b><i>over collateralized</i></b> loans to individuals/institutions. Instead they took massive risks with them.

> I share a similar story to many other depositors who have modest amounts of their net worth locked in Celsius. From spending time on various social media forums and groups I have seen the range of devastation this lockup has caused.

> I like many others were led astray by Mr. Mashinsky and his lies. We trusted the company was ran in a safe and productive manner because their leader always expressed that. I do not believe these terms of services should be deemed valid. There is zero chance I or others would have become a customer of Celsius if their terrible business practices were disclosed.

> Like many investors, I have lost a large chunk of my life savings and struggle to live daily with devastation and extreme stress of watching on the sideline feeling powerless over my money, which I entrusted with Celsius to manage. Alex Mashinsky and Celsius Management have been engaging in deceptive marketing of their platform and products using catchy phrases such as "Unbank yourself" and "Banks are not your friends" to imply that leaving funds with Celsius is just like depositing funds on savings accounts with traditional banks, if not superior.

> Celsius customer base extends beyond the United States and its impacts are far‐reaching and impacting the lives of Non‐US resident depositors like myself.

> This has ruined people beyond comprehension: please peruse r/CelsiusNetwork should you have a human interest in what is happening with people who are not as sophisticated as yourself even. The marketing lies, the deceit, and the lack of accountability will be paid in blood by many.

> This person preyed on fears of losing money during the next economic downturn and lied about how our money/assets were managed.
