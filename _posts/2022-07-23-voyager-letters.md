People with funds locked in Voyager Digital have been sending letters to the judge presiding over the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. These are excerpts from those letters.

It's important to understand that schemes like this in the cryptocurrency industry are hurting real people who are often suffering losses they can't afford. Regardless of what you may believe about individuals' decisions to put significant amounts of money into Voyager, blame lies with the executives creating and running these companies and with the U.S. legal and regulatory system for allowing companies like this to operate.

The goal of highlighting these excerpts is to illustrate this, and shed some light on how people are convinced to put their money into projects like Voyager. Voyager may have been one of the first companies to collapse in the 2022 crypto crash, but it is hardly unique.

All case filings can be viewed on [Stretto](https://cases.stretto.com/Voyager/court-docket). Individual letters are linked alongside their excerpts. I have published similar excerpts [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1550160830762782724), and will be continuing to update as new letters are entered. New letters will go at the top of this post, which is in reverse order based on docket number.

## Background
On July 1, 2022, the cryptocurrency broker Voyager Digital suspended customer withdrawals. On July 6, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Users have continued to be unable to withdraw crypto stored in their Voyager accounts. Some Voyager customers were under the impression that their funds deposited in US dollars were protected from a Voyager bankruptcy by FDIC insurance. Voyager had made statements like, "all customers' USD held with Voyager is now FDIC insured. That means that in the rare event your USD funds are compromised due to the company or our banking partner's failure, you are guaranteed a full reimbursement (up to $250,000)."

## Excerpts

[Doc 124](https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175307212280000000016.pdf), filed July 20, 2022:

> I write as a customer of Voyager, a technologist, and a believer in the mission and potential of blockchain technologies, particularly bitcoin and ethereum.

> ... I became fundamentally sold on the value proposition of bitcoin and ethereum and decided to invest a majority of my savings into both, in light of several sovereign countries introducing cryptocurrency securities as recognized securities.

> I made these purchases on exchanges other than Voyager. However, when I came across Voyager’s online marketing, YouTube video promotions and CEO Steven Ehrlich's interviews of promising FDIC guarantees, well vetted investments, being a publicly traded company; I opened up an account and gradually transferred nearly all of my assets to Voyager.

> I performed extensive due diligence prior to transferring my securities as millions as well did also. I ultimately chose Voyager for the following reasons: The company was publicly listed, implying responsible stewardship of my assets. CEO, Steven Ehrlich, positioned as an industry veteran, working in the capital markets for more than 25 years and achieving the role of CEO of E*Trade Financial’s Professional Trading division. Voyager claimed to have full FDIC protection on USD balances.

> I signed up with Voyager last year based on its trust factor and noting that it was customer-focused as well as a publicly traded company. The money that my wife and I were hoping to use for our young daughter’s education in the future is now locked up.

[Doc 122](https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175307212280000000013.pdf), filed July 21, 2022:

> In the world I live in, I am a small person with mostly small pockets. ... I ask on behalf of my four children that still have college unpaid, that you are our voice and our ears throughout this court case and that the government fairly represent and hear us.

> My family worked for over 24 years to build a family business together that was all our blood, sweat, tears and that took us away from our families for years. We worked hard and long for those twenty-four years. In December of 2020, we sold our family business for a small share for each of us (five owners). I took about ½ of my proceeds from the sale of our company and put it into Voyager on their crypto application. I felt that the money, based on their claims, was safe, FDIC insured and that I was making an investment for the long term.

> I have four children aged 16 years, 12 years, 11 years and 8 years old currently. That money was an investment into their futures to pay for their college. I put over $350,000 into USD coin because of the promises of “safety and security,” from Voyager and 9% interest and “FDIC insured,” USD coin. I also put over $700,000 more in Bitcoin and Ethereum that are now decimated, but that’s on me. I take responsibility for investment and risk, but the Voyager leaders and Voyager Digital, LLC needs to take responsibility for giving us back what we are due, in full

> I am a current customer/depositor of Voyager who has been investing a major portion of my savings into cryptocurrency using Voyager services. I now feel regretful for believing into their marketing strategy and potentially losing my family’s life savings

[Doc 109](https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175307202280000000024.pdf), filed July 20, 2022:

> I ... am a "small investor" & account holder of "Voyager Digital" crypto currency exchange platform and a victim of crypto-currency fraud. ... After signing up with the crypto currency exchange app and purchasing a variety of crypto currency coins such as “Bitcoin , Avalanche , Dogecoin, and Shiba ” on the crypto-currency Exchange platform.

> As a hard working single mother and small investor , I initially used the exchange as a form of a savings account and invested a substantial amount of my savings to purchase crypto currency on the Voyager exchange platform in hopes of saving up for a home, but the opposite has happened, I feel as though , I'm being strategically robbed in a civil way by Voyager Digital . The negligence of this organization has greatly impacted my life and the future of my child's life.

> I'm very worried that this will have an effect on the condition of my life and my state of living for a very long time. My cognition has declined rapidly due to depression because I’m barely able to afford the cost of living and have very little cash left in case of a financial emergency & As a single mother with no family support and without a lucrative career. I may never be able to financially recover from the losses this organization has caused.

> I write as an unsecured creditor who has deposited her entire life savings into the USDC stablecoin under the consistent confirmation of CEO Stephen Ehrlich that we owned our assets. I would have NEVER in a million years taken my hard earned money and put it into an asset that I believed I was not the custodian of. I am not a gambler; the USDC stablecoin does not fluctuate from the US dollar and is “regulated and licensed by institutions that maintain full reserves of the equivalent fiat currency in a 1 USDC : 1 USD ratio.

> I appreciate your consideration in reference to my cash holdings in my Voyager account. I have sold all
my crypto assets in April of 2022 and attempted to withdrawal my cash of $193,585.89 and for reason of
compliance review they have blocked my withdrawal and when I asked as to what the issue is or what is
reason of compliance review they never provided me of a reason.

> Your honor I hope you can see that my claim is fair and should have been honored in May and they
dragged me on in the name of compliance review and locked my account.

[Doc 92](https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175307182280000000049.pdf), filed July 18, 2022:

> I was told about Voyager on April 16th, 2022. I was told of the great yields for holding crypto currency and stable coins on the platform. I was a little skeptical at first but did my own research. Afterall what could go wrong? It’s a U.S. company and publicly traded. I began making large transfers into the platform and converting my USD to USDC a stable coin pegged ot the U.S. dollar. Everything should be ok right? I was unaware of Voyagers fraudulent lending practices as well as their financial situation. I now have over 138,000 of my family’s life savings tied up on the platform and in jeopardy of losing. I have barely spoke with my wife as she is extremely disappointed in the decisions I made for our family. Why should I take the blame and suffer for some careless mistakes made by a few corporate individuals?

> I am current customer of Voyager who has been investing a portion of my paycheck into Voyager every month for the last few years on top of rolling my life savings into this account. I used Voyager to replace my savings account as it was advertised as FDIC insured, I am now filled with regret for doing so and fear that I pretty much lost everything for trusting this company.

[Doc 75](https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175307152280000000015.pdf), filed July 14, 2022:

> I, personally, did not simply deposit my hard earned funds into their custody on a 'whim' to 'gamble' in blond hopes of somehow 'magically' becoming a billionaire. In fact, I did my very best to perform 'due diligence' throughout the massive amounts of public information on the internet. From thoroughly reading dozens of "Best of Cryptocurrency platforms" 2021, 2022, etc. To "Pros and Cons of Voyager crypto". To "Why is Voyager Digital safe". To "Voyager Digital leadership". Throughout each and all of the many links, articles, information, reviews, and recommendations, it seemed like Voyager Digital was presented as "the closest, most safe, non traditional banking platform\_ but for the cryptocurrency world".

> Given the current horrible situation we are now facing with Voyager Digital, it seems evident, purposeful misleading advertisement from Voyager was regurgitated to us interested consumers...

> For me personally, Voyager, purposefully made it so that I was suddenly unable to withdrawal all of my holdings (usd, usdc StableCoins, and cryptocurrencies) rapidly & efficiently in accordance with my $100,000.00 daily withdrawal limit... allowing only $10,000.00 daily. Just prior to Voyager 'freezing' my account holdings, Voyager accepted, allowed, and processed 6 daily $10,000.00 withdrawals = only $60,000.00 versus the just prior 6 daily $100,000.00 daily withdrawals = up to $600,000.00... Manipulating/keeping $540,000.00 from rightfully being withdrawn.
